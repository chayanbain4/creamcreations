WordPress 6.7, code-named &#8220;Rollins,&#8221; pays tribute to the legendary jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins.

His compositions, such as &#8220;St. Thomas,&#8221; &#8220;Oleo,&#8221; and &#8220;Airegin,&#8221; are timeless jazz standards, celebrated for their rhythmic complexity and melodic inventiveness.

class=\"is-style-default has-large-font-size\">In nearly 1,000 days, the WordPress community has created <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">1,000 Block themes</a>—coming together to use the full potential of the Site Editor and unleash new creative possibilities for everyone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"is-style-default\">First introduced in WordPress 5.9, Block themes have steadily evolved, improving flexibility and functionality for themers, users, and agencies alike. Now, design tools allow customizing almost every detail. With style variations, users can change the overall look of their site in a few clicks. You can even use <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/curating-the-editor-experience/\">curation options</a> to customize the editing process itself. But we’re not done! We can’t wait to keep pushing Block themes even further. Thank you to every early adopter who, by embracing early features with passion, helped shape the Block themes we love today with feedback and testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven’t yet explored Block themes, check out some of the resources below to get inspired:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use one of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">1,000 Block themes available</a> and see what you can create.

These conversations may involve sensitive matters, personal experiences, or simply casual exchanges. Regardless of the content, every individual should feel confident that their private communications will remain private unless they grant explicit permission to share them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing private messages without consent is a breach of trust that can also lead to unintended harm, including emotional distress or misrepresentation. When members of our community feel they cannot trust others in their personal conversations, it undermines the collaborative spirit that is crucial to our collective success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How This Change Protects the Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By explicitly addressing the publication of private messages without consent, we are reinforcing an existing unacceptable behavior in our Community Code of Conduct: Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting. Sharing private communications without permission is a clear violation of professional integrity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new addition ensures that private messages receive the same level of protection as personal information and that sensitive communications shared in confidence will not be disclosed without prior consent. An important exception to this is when sharing private messages is necessary for reporting incidents or concerns to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/irt/\">Incident Response Team</a>, as part of our commitment to maintaining a safe and respectful environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, this change encourages honest, constructive engagement across all levels of participation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Moving Forward Together</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The strength of our community lies in the trust we place in one another. By clarifying and reinforcing our expectations, we are taking another step toward maintaining an inclusive, respectful, and safe environment for everyone.This new addition will take effect immediately, and violations will be handled in accordance with our existing <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/#enforcement\">enforcement guidelines</a>. Together, we can ensure our community remains a place of collaboration, trust, and mutual respect.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"17994\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"WordPress Thanks Salesforce\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/thank-you-salesforce/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 18 Oct 2024 20:17:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=18012\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:326:\"In the midst of our legal battles with Silver Lake and WP Engine, I wanted to take a moment to highlight something positive.

We switched from IRC to Slack, and it was like superpowers were unlocked for our team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past 10 years, <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a> has been our secret weapon of productivity compared to many other open source projects. Its amazing collaboration features have allowed us to scale WordPress from running just a few blogs to now powering around 43% of all websites in the world, almost 10 times the runner-up in the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we have scaled from very small to very large, Slack has scaled right alongside us, seemingly effortlessly. WordPress.org currently has 49,286 users on its <a href=\"https://slack.com/pricing\">Slack Business+ instance</a>, which would cost at least $8.8M/yr if we were paying. (And we may need to go to their enterprise grid, to support e-discovery in the lawsuit attacks from WP Engine, which would cost even more.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This incredible generosity was continued by the enlightened leadership of Marc Benioff at Salesforce when they bought Slack in 2020. However, it has not been widely known or recognized on our <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future page</a>, which only highlights self-reported contributor hours and doesn&#8217;t mention Salesforce at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a grave error, and we are correcting it today. Going forward:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>I would like every business in the world to see the amazing collaboration and productivity gains Slack has enabled for our community of tens of thousands of volunteers worldwide and <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">consider adopting it for their own business</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Salesforce will have a complimentary top sponsor slot at our flagship WordCamp events in the <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/\">United States</a>, <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/\">Europe</a>, and <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/\">Asia</a>, which attract thousands of people each.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We will update our <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future program</a> to reflect contributions such as Salesforce&#8217;s going forward.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We just want to repeat: Thank you.

This first-of-its-kind initiative was born out of a desire to bridge the gap between students and the WordPress ecosystem and also to grow the local community. As an active member of the WordPress community, I often noticed the need to introduce fresh talent to the platform and create a space where students could learn, grow, and connect with the global WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I shared this idea with our local community members, and we decided to design an event tailored specifically for students, providing them with hands-on exposure to WordPress and opening doors to potential career opportunities. Over the course of 23 days in October 2024, we conducted a WordPress workshop in four colleges in Ajmer, India, to bring this vision to life through engaging seminars and workshops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What began as an experimental event has now set a foundation for nurturing the next generation of WordPress enthusiasts and contributors. In this blog post, we’ll discuss WP Campus Connect&#8217;s highlights, achievements, and incredible journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Event Format</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When we decided to organize a WordPress event exclusively for students, the big question was: How do we gather interested students, and where? Instead of asking them to come to us, we chose to meet them where they are—on their campuses. That’s how the event got its name: WP Campus Connect. We also decided that unlike other WordPress events, where attendees had to purchase the ticket, we removed this barrier and kept it free for all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We decided to partner with four colleges, making it a multi-day event planned across four Saturdays in October. Though we had to adjust the schedule along the way (more on that later!), the concept remained the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once our proposal was approved by the WordCamp Central, we started pitching the idea to colleges. The plan was to conduct 5-6 hour workshops in each college to introduce students to WordPress and career opportunities in web development. However, WordPress awareness in our region was low, and convincing colleges wasn’t easy. Out of six colleges we approached, four partnered with us after seeing the potential impact of the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedback from our partner colleges added another layer to our format. Most students had never heard of WordPress, so jumping straight into workshops might not have been effective. To address this, we introduced a pre-event seminar in each college. These 90-minute sessions aimed to familiarize students with WordPress, its global impact, career opportunities, and the upcoming workshops—ensuring they were motivated and prepared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maintain quality, we capped participation at 100 students per college, considering the infrastructure provided and our capacity to deliver a meaningful experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, our final format became:<br /><strong>4 Colleges, 4 Seminars, 4 Workshops, and introducing WordPress to 400 students.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Event Planning &amp; Execution</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Team</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the event format was finalized and approved, it was time to turn the vision into reality. Organizing WP Campus Connect required meticulous planning, dedicated teamwork, and the support of our vibrant community. With a clear roadmap ahead, the next step was to form a team and assign responsibilities to ensure everything was executed smoothly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We built a 10-member organizing team, with each member taking on a specific role based on their expertise. Here’s how we divided the tasks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Program Team:</strong> Crafted the workshop flow, deciding what to teach, how to teach it, and ensuring the sessions were engaging and impactful.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>College Coordinator:</strong> Liaised with our partner colleges to ensure we had the necessary infrastructure for the seminars and workshops, from projectors to seating arrangements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Design Team:</strong> Created promotional materials, session slides, certificates, and other visual assets that gave the event a polished and professional feel.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sponsorship Team:</strong> Focused on securing funds by reaching out to sponsors, ensuring we had the financial backing needed to organize the event seamlessly.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Social Media and Content Team:</strong> Managed promotions across platforms, kept the community engaged, and shared regular updates about the event. They were also responsible for creating engaging content, such as announcements, blog posts, and updates, to amplify excitement and spread awareness.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Every aspect, from logistics to content creation and online engagement, was managed collaboratively, with frequent check-ins to track progress and address challenges. With each team member playing their part, we turned the concept of WP Campus Connect into a well-coordinated, impactful event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This teamwork not only made the event possible but also strengthened the bonds within our community, showcasing the power of collaboration in achieving ambitious goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Student Selection: Ensuring the Right Participants</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With participation capped at 100 students per college, the respective colleges were responsible for selecting attendees. To ensure a fair and effective process, all colleges followed a similar pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each pre-event seminar was conducted for a larger audience, introducing students to WordPress, its career potential, and the workshop objectives. Following the seminar, the college faculty invited students to express their interest in joining the workshop. This allowed students who were genuinely motivated and eager to learn to step forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on these expressions of interest, the final list of workshop attendees was prepared. This approach ensured that the workshops were filled with enthusiastic participants who were ready to make the most of the learning opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Event Days: Bringing WP Campus Connect to Life</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The event days were the highlight of WP Campus Connect, with seminars and workshops conducted at all four partner colleges. Each session was tailored to inspire and engage students, introducing them to the power of WordPress and its vast career opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Seminars: Setting the Stage</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The 90-minute seminars introduced WordPress, its global presence, and its potential as a career path. While engaging a large audience within this short timeframe was challenging, we managed to keep the sessions interactive and enjoyable, ensuring students left motivated and curious.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Workshops: Hands-On Learning</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While the seminars only required two team members, the workshops were a full team effort. Each workshop was approximately 5-6 hours long and designed to provide students with hands-on experience building their first WordPress website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The college infrastructure varied, adding a layer of complexity. At one college, a single large computer lab accommodated all participants, allowing one lead facilitator to guide the session while others assisted. In other colleges, the workshops were split across multiple rooms. To maintain consistency, we conducted an internal team session before the event to ensure every facilitator was aligned on the workshop structure and delivery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We helped students build their first WordPress websites, set up WordPress, understand themes and plugins, manage pages and posts, and more. In this hands-on workshop, they built a website home page, set up a blog, and added a contact form to the site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Breaks and Activities</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Workshops included a small break where we provided refreshments and set up fun activities like photo booths. These activities added a lively touch and allowed students to interact and capture memories of their day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Closing Moments</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Each workshop concluded with a feedback session, during which we interacted with students, learned about their experiences, and encouraged them to join our Meetup group to continue their learning journey with the WordPress community. Participation certificates and swag were distributed to all attendees, leaving them with a token of their experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The events wrapped up with group photos, which captured the energy and excitement of the day—a perfect end to a successful event.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2024/12/image-3.jpeg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2024/12/image-3-1024x682.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8797843\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2024/12/image-2.jpeg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2024/12/image-2-1024x682.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8797842\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2024/12/image-1.jpeg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2024/12/image-1-1024x682.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8797841\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2024/12/image.jpeg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2024/12/image-1024x682.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8797840\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenges Faced</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One major challenge was ensuring the required infrastructure at partner colleges. While students were encouraged to bring their own laptops, many relied on college computer labs. At some colleges, outdated systems and missing configurations made it difficult to install the necessary software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To overcome this, we used <strong>InstaWP</strong> to spin up temporary WordPress sites, allowing students to work seamlessly without delays. This quick solution ensured the workshops ran smoothly and introduced students to an innovative way of using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Final Impact</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Through WP Campus Connect, we introduced WordPress to over 370 students, sparking a newfound enthusiasm among many of them. The impact became evident at our next meetup, which saw a record-breaking attendance of over 50 participants—most of whom were new members. What stood out was their active involvement. They were not just attending but also contributing ideas for future meetups, showcasing their eagerness to engage further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the growing number of attendees, we recognized the need for a larger venue. One of our partner colleges stepped forward and is now a venue sponsor for our meetups, solidifying their support for the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another exciting outcome was the suggestion to establish <strong>Student WP Clubs</strong> within colleges. These clubs can help sustain in-campus activities and introduce WordPress to students who missed the WP Campus Connect event. It can be a critical step toward ensuring the long-term growth and sustainability of the local WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking ahead, we’re in talks with stakeholders and exploring possibilities to integrate WordPress into the college curriculum soon. This initiative has the potential to embed WordPress knowledge at an academic level, equipping students with a competitive edge by the time they graduate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The momentum from WP Campus Connect has strengthened our local community and set a strong foundation for continued growth, innovation, and collaboration.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 05 Dec 2024 06:25:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Anand Upadhyay\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: ClikIT Acquires UglyRobot’s Infinite Uploads and Big File Uploads Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=181425\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/clikit-acquires-uglyrobots-infinite-uploads-and-big-file-uploads-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2618:\"<p>ClikIT has <a href=\"https://clikitnow.com/clikit-acquires-infinite-uploads-big-file-uploads/\">announced</a> its acquisition of the Infinite Uploads and Big File Uploads plugins from UglyRobot, LLC, owned by Aaron Edwards, the former CTO of WPMU DEV.

We’re also leveraging Big File Uploads, used by over 100,000 websites, to simplify the process of uploading large files and bypassing web host limits. Our goal is to make managing WordPress websites as seamless as possible, and these plugins move us closer to that goal.”&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Existing customers will not notice any changes in billing, their portal, support emails, or even the description on their credit card statements. Much of the Infinite Uploads infrastructure was separate from UglyRobot’s other assets, meaning we didn’t need to decouple or migrate any data.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how school educators are bringing WordPress to the people of Uganda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Stephen Dumba.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stephen has been a high school teacher in Uganda since 2007. He specializes in WordPress, computer repair, and teaching IT skills. As the National Coordinator of the ICT Teachers Association of Uganda, he mentors, both students and teachers in ICT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An active WordPress community members since 2019, Stephen organizes WordCamps and conducts online, and in-person, WordPress training across Uganda. Initiatives like Each One Teach One, and 1000 WordPress Ninjas aim to promote the use of WordPress nationwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stephen regularly speaks at WordPress events, and focuses on integrating WordPress into education and community building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suspect many listeners might not know about the landscape of WordPress and ICT education in Uganda. Stephen is here to correct that today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start off talking about the ICT curriculum in Uganda, the initiatives to equip schools with computer labs, and the surge in student interest for ICT education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then discuss how WordPress is beginning to see adoption in Ugandan educational circles and Meetup communities. Stephen talks about how investing in WordPress turned his business around, and the larger impact it has had on education and employment opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why is WordPress so embraced in Uganda? Stephen emphasizes its simplicity, extensive plugin options, and community support. He also describes the vibrant WordPress community initiatives, including regular Meetups, and the goal to host a thousand attendee WordPress event in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast, we discussed Stephen&#8217;s vision for building future WordPress leaders in Uganda, and the significance of sponsorships, and financial support, to sustain and grow these initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about how WordPress is shaping communities and education in Uganda, and the broader implications of ICT education in different regions, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Stephen Dumba.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Stephen Dumba. Hello Stephen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:44] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> Hi Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> This is going to be a really interesting episode for me. There&#8217;s going to be an awful lot in here that I do not know about. We&#8217;re not going to be talking about WordPress, the code. We&#8217;re going to be talking about WordPress, the community, and how it&#8217;s grown up in the country where Stephen lives, which is Uganda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And before we begin that, Stephen, I just want to give you the opportunity to tell us a little bit about yourself, your history with WordPress, the job that you do, and then we can unpack all of the wonderful things that you are involved with in Uganda. So over to you, your little potted bio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> Thank you, Nathan. I am Stephen Dumba. By profession I&#8217;m a teacher, but many times when I tell people that I&#8217;m a teacher, the next question is, where do you teach? Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not stationed in a particular school where I&#8217;m teaching, but I&#8217;m a teacher by profession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve been, for the past 15 years, interested in computer repair. And then of recent, around 2018, I got invited to WordCamp Kampala. So that&#8217;s where my WordPress journey started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I attended a WordPress event in 2018, at the close of 2018, and then I got an opportunity to speak at WordCamp Entebbe three months later. That was in 2019. And then from then on, I discovered that, yeah, I think this is a field that I can put all my energy on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I started developing websites in WordPress. But most importantly, I found that many of my fellow teachers were not well versed with web design and WordPress. So because of my role as the National Coordinator of the ICT Teachers Association of Uganda here, I took on the role of mentorship, a voluntary mentor. So I&#8217;ve trained many teachers in Uganda on how to use WordPress, and that&#8217;s how we are growing as a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you for that. That was really enlightening. So just to reiterate, you began your journey in 2017, having not used WordPress before. But also at the same time as that, a history of teaching, and with a current role of the National Coordinator of the ICT Association of Uganda, which sounds like a fairly influential role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I mean by that is I&#8217;m guessing that if you make some decisions about what CMS may be on offer to the school children in Uganda, your decisions count for something because of the role that you have. Would that be fair to say, your decisions matter?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:23] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s a personal decision, but it is a decision of a couple of us as teachers. You see, what we call the ICT Teachers Association of Uganda is a congregation of teachers who teach ICT as a subject here in Uganda, across the entire country. So basing on the conversations we have on our platforms, majorly WhatsApp, you come up with a decision even when no one mentions it. You find that it is easier to build websites with WordPress. And all the reasons are there for us to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously when I was still teaching, we used to teach web design as one of the topics in our subject, but we were using very rudimentary tools. We would even use stuff like Office to come up with something like a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I got to know about WordPress, shared it with a few teachers, and by the way, I was introduced to WordPress by a fellow teacher, and by then he was the national coordinator of the ICT Teachers Association. He&#8217;s called Rogers Mukalele.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So he invites us to a group of WordPress users because he wanted us to improve on our skills, our web development skills. And then when it came that there was a WordCamp in 2018, I remember it was December, either November or December, WordCamp Kampala. We all went there just to see how are these people making websites, because they&#8217;re telling us in just a day you can come up with something so beautiful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when we went there and, true to his words, people had at least a homepage in just one or two hour session. So from there on, everyone was convinced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for us who had gone, we started sharing with those who hadn&#8217;t gone to this event. And so when Arthur organised WordCamp Entebbe in 2019, many teachers were like, we also want to go to WordCamp and learn how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s how I came up with the idea, wow, so I can speak at this event to the teachers. Because usually they take people, the way they communicate with teachers, it may not be as straightforward or as simple as us teachers understand ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I thought I&#8217;d give this talk, and good enough this talk is even on, my very first is on WordPress TV. Things went on, and so people started seeing us as the go-to people for WordPress. And because of that, we had to keep on improving our skills. And so all other WordPress events that were organised in Uganda, I struggled hard to make sure that at least I catered for that particular audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So finally, Rogers goes out of this role of national coordinator and everyone was like, I think Steve, you can do this. Steve, be our national coordinator, please. Who&#8217;s going to teach us WordPress? Who&#8217;s going to mentor us in this field? And because of our association, people believe in what we say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when we tell them it&#8217;s good to have WordPress, we give them the figures of course, 43% of the web. And then when you come to government agencies here, I even wrote an article about 10 common websites in Uganda that are using WordPress, of which we have State House, that&#8217;s the President&#8217;s official home. He&#8217;s using WordPress. Then we have the tax body in Uganda, switched to WordPress. We have universities in Uganda are using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we were giving just those big, big, big agencies as examples. And then when we tell you that you can do something in a day, you can come up with an idea and build something in WordPress, and maybe improve that later, everyone would like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, not many of our schools in Uganda have websites. So teachers had space where they could practice their WordPress skills. They would go to the head teacher, tell them, I developed some WordPress skills. Can I volunteer to build a school website? And so the teacher would volunteer, and then ask us some questions, we would guide them. And where we fail, we would also go to the more advanced community, the WordPress community of Uganda. And they&#8217;re also very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I ask, where I live in the UK, we have an education system called the National Curriculum, and what that means is that basically every child receives, certainly when they&#8217;re very young, the same subjects. So if you&#8217;re a child in an entirely different part of the country, you&#8217;ll still be having basically the same palette of subjects, you&#8217;ll be doing maths, and history, and what we call ICT. And the ICT, in our case, stands for Information Communication Technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that the same in Uganda? Do you have one sort of curriculum which covers the whole country, or can different areas and different schools pursue whatever they like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:08] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> In Uganda we also have a curriculum developed by the National Curriculum Development Center, and it is across the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, thank you. And also, what is the current state of technology like in Uganda? So where I live there&#8217;s lots of desktop computers. There&#8217;s lots of mobile phones. I&#8217;m curious as to how people are consuming the internet. Is it generally a keyboard with a screen, or does it tend to be more like a mobile phone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:37] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> The adoption of technologies in Uganda is still very, very, very low. Although, since the lockdown, there has been some improvement. However, I also like to mention, what we call the Uganda Communications Commission. They have been instrumental in making sure that secondary schools, that is for students from 13 to 18 years, they&#8217;ve ensured that all secondary schools at least have a computer lab of at least 30 users, 30 user stations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is something that came around more seriously in 2013, because then ICT as a subject was introduced to advanced level. That is for the, 17, 18 year olds. It came as a compulsory subject.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way, in Uganda, students start learning ICT at 13. Below that, the curriculum doesn&#8217;t cater for that. So the curriculum starts it as an option at 13 years onwards. But in 2013, the government thought it wise to introduce this as a compulsory subject for the 17 and 18 year olds, what we call A Level here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because not all schools would afford to have computer labs, our communications agency, the Uganda Communications Commission, through their project which is now called UCUSAF, they came up with an idea and stocked computer labs across the entire country. So the chances of finding a computer lab in a secondary school are almost I think 90, I&#8217;ll give a figure of 90%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And would it be fair to say that home ownership of computers is not particularly widespread? Or would it be that most people going home would have access to a computer or a mobile phone, once they&#8217;re outside of the boundaries of the school?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:28] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> It is not widespread. It&#8217;s not at all widespread. Computers will only be found in offices, and that is big offices. Computers only be found now in secondary schools, apart from a very few privileged schools that will have maybe a hundred computers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So young people, their exposure to computers is typically going to be in their educational institute, their school, or the college that they go to. And is the interest in ICT, well, is ICT as a subject popular in the same way that it is in my country? I mean, it&#8217;s almost the most exciting thing you can do to a child where I live, to put them in front of computers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems that there&#8217;s just something about that interaction of the keyboard, the mouse, the computer, and all of the myriad things that it can do that is tremendously exciting. And also it&#8217;s a conduit to learning almost every other subject as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But is it something that the children themselves are excited about, learning how to work with computers? Or is it more that, a bit like maybe something like maths is here, you&#8217;re just kind of told you&#8217;ve got to do it because you&#8217;ve got to do it. Like I say, is it popular?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:45] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> ICT is a very popular subject here in my country. I&#8217;ve even given the numbers. I remember, the last school where I taught, you would have a class of 80 learners and you had only 30 computers. And the kids had to struggle into the lab just to be the first on the computer. You just have to come out with ways of grouping them, and making sure that each of these learners has a chance to touch and use the computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, because of this demand where I was, I was often asked to come to school earlier than the official reporting time. For example, being at school at around seven so the kids can use the time between seven and nine, for those who did not have the chance to practice, to use the lab. And then even after work, after five, you&#8217;ll be obliged to stay at school up to around eight, so that you give chance to other learners, because the interest is just too much, just like the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So there&#8217;s loads of demand, but not enough places to put that demand. At the moment there simply aren&#8217;t enough devices for the amount of children, in this case, who wish to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an exciting thing to be involved in then I guess, because I think a lot of teachers, certainly in the UK, face the problem of disinterested children. Children who don&#8217;t wish to study a particular subject, and yet they&#8217;re being made to teach it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas it sounds like you&#8217;ve got the opposite problem. You&#8217;ve got children who are extremely interested to learn, but aren&#8217;t able to because, well, there&#8217;s a big queue to get into the ICT lab, and you&#8217;ve got to take your turn. Come before school begins, or wait after school has finished in order to give it a go. Okay, that&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:31] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> If I can add, it&#8217;s for that reason that at a certain point we take these kids through a test to decide who will stay with us in the computer lab at a certain level. So when you have a class of 80 students, where as a teacher you could imagine, the African way, the problem is when it comes to time for assessment exams, are you going to spend two days in the computer lab examining in just one subject? No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we do, if there are 80 students in your class, they&#8217;ll have to go through a test that will determine, and unfortunately we usually choose the best performers. And so we could say we need only 40 students. And so you leave out 40. Not that they don&#8217;t want, they are really interested, everyone is interested, but you don&#8217;t have just enough equipment to serve them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Again, linking back to the UK because it&#8217;s basically what I know. In the UK the ICT curriculum covers a lot of ground, it isn&#8217;t just about the web. And I wondered if that was the case as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously the WordPress component is about building something which could go online ultimately, perhaps a website or something like that. But also they learn about programming languages, and how to write things in code on their local development environment, and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you cover any of that as well, or is it mainly to do with the internet, websites, WordPress, that kind of thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:55] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> Not at all. In fact, websites is just part of the curriculum. They learn, of course, the obvious stuff, it&#8217;s basically learning Microsoft Office programs, and then web, and then there is security, a little bit of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our new curriculum, right now we don&#8217;t have coding, we don&#8217;t have programming. What we have is a bit of HTML and CSS before we involve them in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do the students have career opportunities outside of school, once school has finished? Is that maybe why it&#8217;s so popular? Apart from the fact that it&#8217;s obviously quite interesting sitting in front of a computer, you know, it opens up a whole world of possibilities. Is there also a credible career path with that as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I can imagine that if you were successful, let&#8217;s say you were incredibly good at building websites with WordPress, I can imagine that the career, the opportunities, would allow you to step outside your own town, your own region, your own country. And so I just wondered if there was a career path that the children could understand and conceive. That it would allow the world to be more available to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:04] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> As teachers, we have shown them some career paths, like the standard web developer, stuff like that. But given that, in our country, the chances of getting employed are really so minimal. So most of these kids are learning it, first for the interest, but then they are also looking at the opportunities. They look at people like us that, yes, he has his own web development agency, that is Steve. You look at Rogers, he&#8217;s also surviving his way because of that skill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even when we are going in our mentorship talks with them, we show them that, learn this skill and you&#8217;ll be self-reliant after school. You&#8217;re not going to depend on someone who&#8217;s going to ask for your CV, someone who&#8217;s going to ask for your experience when you&#8217;re just fresh out of school. Many of them are learning it right now because they want to make a buck by themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, that&#8217;s brilliant. Thank you. And can I just ask, why WordPress? Given all of the different bits and pieces out there. I mean, obviously you attended the event in 2017, and that turned your head towards WordPress, but I&#8217;ve got to imagine there&#8217;s more to it than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it just that it is a tool which is, well, I mean for a start it&#8217;s freely available? You just go to a website and there it is, and you can download it, and there&#8217;s loads of software available that allows you to install it on a local environment, so you don&#8217;t need to pay for a hosting company or anything like that. What were the reasons that WordPress was the CMS of choice, the software of choice?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:35] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> First of all is the ease with which you create this website. So I&#8217;ll give my personal example. And by the way, the teachers and learners follow my story so much, and it&#8217;s an inspiring one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around 2015, I hired a friend of mine to create a website for me. And we went through ping pong for some months, and then even after all those months, the website wasn&#8217;t really what I wanted. And then they told me that it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re using a friend to do it. You&#8217;re doing it cheaply. So you have to get some good money and hire another web developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I got my, I think it was three months salary, I gave it to a person to develop a website who did not come up with a website even after a, you get it, yeah. Now look at, after a whole year you don&#8217;t have a website, some sketchy. And then in school we were teaching using Publisher. I don&#8217;t know if you heard about Microsoft Publisher, we were using it to create websites. And the websites are so sketchy versus the websites we see on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here you go to an event in the morning. You arrive at nine, get breakfast at 10, go into a session at 11, and at 2 you have a website. Who wouldn&#8217;t want to use that tool? And in fact, all my interests right now, like I told you before, I repair computers. So the only people who knew that I repair computers are the people in my community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I learned WordPress, I came up with a website, a website using WordPress. I think I used maybe two nights and it&#8217;s out there. And now because of this website, I&#8217;m traveling across the country. Now the people who are following my story will also want to do their own websites because of the ease with which you can use it to come up with a deserving website. A website that a client will look at and say, wow, this is what I wanted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it is even easier, even if you looked at another website for inspiration, it is easier to come out with a similar website in WordPress, as opposed to the other hard coding, that is one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other thing is, there&#8217;s one thing that I really look at, WordPress has a community in Uganda. You&#8217;ll simply call David, hi, I have a problem here. David will help you. Then you say, who can help me with this? And then they&#8217;ll lead you to another person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then look at the problems like when you want to monetise your website, when you want to add payment gateways to your website. All the other options that are available, it&#8217;ll take you a lot of effort to get them working. Whereas in WordPress, you&#8217;ll just dream of something, oh, I need this, then go to the plugin repository and the plugin is there. Even the free ones are working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just for example, as teachers, during the lockdown we wanted students to be able to access lessons when they are at home, while we were also in our homes. On WordPress, you&#8217;ll just go and look one LMS, and it creates a very perfect learning solution for you, just within no time. So I think there are very many reasons why you should love WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And let me tell you what, even the big agencies here, they were using other technologies. But we have been following them in the last maybe four years. All the big ones are getting to WordPress. So if we don&#8217;t know the reason why we want WordPress, perhaps they know the reason why they want WordPress. You get it, eh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even those, the naysayers who are still doubting WordPress, when they look at State House going for WordPress. When they look at our revenue agency going for WordPress. When they look at our Business Registration Bureau going for WordPress. When they look at our universities going for WordPress, then who are you? You have to give us a very big reason to choose any other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess modern WordPress with things like built-in patterns, so the ability to just basically click a button and have a pre-designed page, or row, or selection of blocks, really leans into that real ease of putting something on a page immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in the olden days, you would probably still have to have a variety of different plugins to wrangle to get things the way that you wanted it to look, but you&#8217;d also have to have a degree of HTML knowledge. And it sounds like, you know, especially for the people who are just beginning with WordPress, those kind of features are really key for getting that excitement going. Look, log in, click that button, and then that one, you&#8217;ve got a page, look at that. And you get something almost immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you disseminate, or how do you communicate with all the other staff where you want to share your experience about WordPress? How do you communicate with all the other teachers throughout the country to coordinate what you&#8217;re doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:21] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> Like I said earlier, I am the National Coordinator of the ICT Teachers Association of Uganda. The ICT Teachers Association of Uganda brings all teachers of ICT in Uganda together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one of the ways, yes, we have a website, ictteachersug.net, but for easier communication we use our WhatsApp platform. Right now we are using WhatsApp majorly. So when we are there, sometimes someone will ask a question, and someone will say, can you ask Stephen? He has been there, he has done that. And when they ask you, you tell them the whole story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we did, we came up with a few initiatives. For example, every Tuesday evenings 8:00 to 9:00 PM East African time, we have what we call Each One, Teach One. We believe no one has the monopoly over knowledge. There is something I know that Nathan doesn&#8217;t know. There is something that Nathan knows that I don&#8217;t know, and a hundred others don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we do in this session, Each One, Teach One, we get a topic that is on everyone&#8217;s mouth. And then we get one person to come and facilitate, and then you take them through an hour. They&#8217;ll ask you questions and stuff like that. And these topics are diverse. Sometimes it&#8217;s just motivation. Sometimes it&#8217;s really, how do I get started with WordPress? And then, how do I deal with SEO? The topics are very diverse, but we come together because we are a fraternity, and we have that objective of bettering ourselves inside and outside our profession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So that&#8217;s an online event, you do that via the internet. But you also mentioned that there&#8217;s a fairly vibrant WordCamp community that goes on with a variety of events across Uganda each year. Did I get that right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:14] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> Yeah. Now look at this, the story goes, Rogers comes and invites us to join the WordPress community of Uganda, which was based in Kampala then. And then three months later, we have an event in Entebbe, under WordPress Entebbe Meetup. So from there, the teachers who had traveled miles to come and attend this event are like, can&#8217;t we have such events nearer our places?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Rogers comes up with the idea, I think I can start a WordPress Meetup in Jinja, that is 80 kilometers away from Kampala. And then in collaboration with existing meetups, we ask that these events should also include sessions for teachers and learners, not only the advanced topics. Also get to the basics, the beginners, the absolute beginners. So Rogers initiates WordPress Jinja Meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the lockdown, Moses initiates the WordPress Masaka Meetup. This is another teacher. And then in Lira we have another WordPress also initiated by a fellow teacher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these are done in collaboration with the existing meetups, and it is one community. But because of these distances, Stephen cannot come from here and travel 400 kilometers to attend a meetup. So it is better if a meetup group is started in that town. So even of recent, we have another Moses who started another meetup just outside Kampala, but Lira was started by Emmanuel Angoda. And more meetups are coming up by the way, because many teachers are interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It does sound like the teachers are the backbone of the whole thing. The WordPress community is largely being driven by the teachers because, you know, they attend this one thing, and then go and start another little satellite meetup, which then is sprouting another meetup and so on. But it does sound like the teaching network is the thing which is really driving the community over there, which is interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:17] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> That would be a lot of pride on our side so that the teachers are the backbone of the WordPress community. Like I said, teachers work hand in hand with existing meetups because we engage with these people every other day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our request was that we work hand in hand to have more inclusive WordCamps, or more inclusive meetups. While the previous meetups were for advanced users, that is in our own thinking. Things were too advanced for us. You go to an event and people are speaking APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we were like, how about we had a meetup, we had a WordCamp where even an absolute beginner, a person who only knows how to click, can come up with a website on that day. And this was a welcome idea, so we are working hand in hand. The thing is that, with teachers, at least they have places where they can put these events, as in the schools. They have somewhere to start. It is easier for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I was going to ask about exactly that, about the location, because that can be quite a thing where we are, finding a location can be really hard. But I guess that&#8217;s a good short circuit, isn&#8217;t it? Because the teachers have access to a building. They have access to a computer lab, which they can use for the evening. Okay, I see. That all hangs together perfectly, doesn&#8217;t it? The school is, in a sense, the central place where it all happens, and the teachers are the people who make it happen in those locations. That&#8217;s fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s really interesting because here in the UK,, the WordPress community is usually not really the school, there&#8217;s no part of the educational system which is involved in it. It&#8217;s typically business owners, people building websites, people who&#8217;ve got companies where they&#8217;re selling something into the WordPress space, those kind of things. And they&#8217;re typically done in, I don&#8217;t know, venues of an evening, but schools don&#8217;t appear to be part of it. So there is quite a difference there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there anything, Stephen, that you would say, if you could stare into the future, sort of five years or something like that, is there anything that you would like to happen? Now that could be as straightforward as, well, it would be great if we had more computers, or more members in our communities. I&#8217;m just thinking, five years, what would you like to be different in five years than is now with the Uganda community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:42] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> One thing we want with the community, in five years one of our dreams is to have an event with a thousand attendees. An event with a thousand attendees is testament of the years of efforts that we are put into building this. It&#8217;ll be really heartbreaking if after all those years of pushing WordPress, you still have an event with 50, 80, 200 attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to see my students as speakers. I want to see them as organisers at events. I want them to come up and say, that&#8217;s our teacher. That is the person who introduced me to WordPress. And I want to see many of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indirectly, this is good market for those who are in the business of web design, like I intend to be. The more people that we know who are interested in WordPress, it&#8217;ll be easier for us to mobilise people for events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s things that really pain us, sometimes we have an event and all you have is international sponsors. You don&#8217;t have any local sponsor for this event. It shows you that the people who are in charge don&#8217;t know about WordPress yet. So let us train these young ones, and when they are in charge they&#8217;ll be very willing to support, to give back to the community, even if they don&#8217;t attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What a fabulous, fabulous thought. The idea of an event of that magnitude with homegrown talent, if you know what I mean. The people that over the last many years you have been teaching, who are themselves the speakers, and presumably would themselves be now the teachers of the next generation as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;re kind of describing a thing which self perpetuates itself into the future. It just keeps going, and you&#8217;ve got the older generation who&#8217;ve been doing it for a while, the ones who are currently working inside of WordPress. And at the same time you&#8217;ve got the people who are coming up through the education system. That is such a fabulous, fabulous, idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another question around that then, Stephen, is the financial thing I suppose, talking about how we get these events to work. Now, you mentioned that events are in schools and things like that,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>but I&#8217;m just wondering if there&#8217;s something that you</p>\n\n\n\n<p>would like to say regarding, I don&#8217;t know, sponsorship, or</p>\n\n\n\n<p>people reaching out to assist in some way or</p>\n\n\n\n<p>other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:59] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> one thing is. our community is entirely, we work entirely on our own resources, personal resources. It&#8217;s voluntary, but the demand for WordPress lessons is so high. And of recent, we started, an initiative called 1000 WordPress Ninjas. and our target was with three friends of mine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a teacher called Noeline and another teacher called Simon. So we came up with the idea, let us at least give ourselves a target of training a thousand youth and teens in WordPress, especially those who are finding it hard to continue with school. is, easier to get those in school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are many others who are there that we interact with. They are struggling with school. So you want to teach them, stuff like WordPress and life skills, indirectly life skills, but majorly WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then they really want to associate with us. So they ask, but what really shows that I&#8217;m a WordPress Ninja. Then we ask them, what do you want? Then they say, don&#8217;t you have a T-shirt? But they cannot even afford this T-shirt. So while I can offer the lessons free, I don&#8217;t have enough money on me to buy T-shirts for a thousand learners. So there are those small things that any other person can come up and any idea and say, perhaps I will get a thousand T-shirts for these a thousand WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ninjas Anything in anyway. And then sometimes there are places that are far remote that would also be interested, but we go there only when we can afford. So even if they ask me to go for this session this weekend, they ask for a session this weekend. As long as I don&#8217;t have enough money on me, I tell them maybe next month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And sometimes I can push it to two, three, even six months. But if. There is a way that we can come up with something small. It can facilitate one of us to go to that place maybe 600 kilometers away, stay a night, have a day or two with them, and then come back. But otherwise, everything is voluntary by using our own pockets But any assistance would be Very welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it&#8217;s the perfect place to end it, Stephen. Before we do end it, I&#8217;m just going to ask, where could people reach out to you? Either personally or perhaps that&#8217;s a website for the institute that you are in charge of? The National Coordinator of the ICT Teachers Association of Uganda. Anywhere that we can find you, email, social media, whatever you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:31] <strong>Stephen Dumba:</strong> Yeah. So I&#8217;m on X, people can find me on X and my handle is SteveUG. Our website of the ICT Teacher Association is ictteachersug.net.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> All of these links will head into the show notes, so if you go to wptavern.com and search for this episode with Stephen, you&#8217;ll be able to find all of the links there. All I can say is thank you so much for all of the hard work that you&#8217;ve put in so far. It sounds like you&#8217;ve got a really interesting, growing community over there, and also good luck for the future. I hope that in the next five years you do indeed put on a WordCamp with a thousand people. That would be absolutely marvelous. Thank you for talking to me today.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today, we have <a href=\"https://x.com/SteveUG\">Stephen Dumba</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stephen has been a high school teacher in Uganda since 2007. He specialises in WordPress, computer repair, and teaching IT skills. As the National Coordinator of the ICT Teachers’ Association of Uganda, he mentors both students and teachers in ICT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An active WordPress community member since 2019, Stephen organises WordCamps and conducts online and in-person WordPress training across Uganda. Initiatives like Each One Teach One and 1000 WordPress Ninjas, aim to promote the use of WordPress nationwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stephen regularly speaks at WordPress events, and focuses on integrating WordPress into education and community-building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suspect many listeners might not know about the landscape of WordPress and ICT education in Uganda. Stephen is here to correct that today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start off talking about the ICT curriculum in Uganda, the initiatives to equip schools with computer labs, and the surge in student interest for ICT education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then discuss how WordPress is beginning to see adoption in Ugandan educational circles and Meetup communities. Stephen talks about how investing in WordPress turned his business around, and the larger impact it has had on education and employment opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, why is WordPress so embraced in Uganda?

For a limited time, grab your free domain with any of these extensions:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column has-base-color has-text-color has-link-color has-open-sans-font-family wp-elements-ae52d8d5dc336e777914180cf1bf9052 is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><code>.bio</code> <br /><code>.fyi</code>  <br /><code>.life</code> <br /><code>.ninja</code> <br /><code>.rocks</code></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column has-base-color has-text-color has-link-color has-open-sans-font-family wp-elements-b7b18e677a16d85cd1a26a16d671055a is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><code>.contact</code> <br /><code>.guru</code> <br /><code>.link</code> <br /><code>.place</code> <br /><code>.social</code></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column has-base-color has-text-color has-link-color has-open-sans-font-family wp-elements-20d01e2c2515e7e931fe5e740ca60988 is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><code>.cool</code> <br /><code>.info</code>  <br /><code>.live</code> <br /><code>.pro</code> <br /><code>.world</code></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Your domain isn&#8217;t just a URL — it&#8217;s your identity on the open web. Use it for your Gravatar profile, email signature, business cards, and now&#8230;your Bluesky handle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level Up Your Bluesky Game</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bsky.social/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bluesky</a> is growing in popularity, and it&#8217;s doing usernames differently. Instead of traditional @usernames, Bluesky uses domains as handles. This means your Gravatar domain can be your Bluesky identity too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, new Bluesky users get a generic <em>yourname.bsky.social</em> domain. But to verify ownership of your account, you can use any domain you own, like <em>yourname.link</em> or <em>yourname.social</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Gravatar, we&#8217;ve made it super simple:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Claim your free domain on Gravatar</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Connect your Bluesky account</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use your domain as your Bluesky handle</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>No DNS configuration needed. No technical hassles. Just a sleek, professional identity that&#8217;s truly yours.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your online identity should be in your control. With a custom domain, you&#8217;re not tied to any platform&#8217;s naming rules. You own it. You control it. You can use it anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom domains build trust and recognition. When people see your own domain instead of a generic link, they&#8217;re more likely to remember and engage with your content. It&#8217;s a simple way to make your online presence more professional and credible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get Started Now</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to claim your piece of the web? Head to your <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/profile\">Gravatar dashboard</a> and look for the claim a domain option at the top of your profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember — these domains are free for the first year, but only for a limited time.

A <a href=\"https://www.ghostery.com/blog/privacy-report-advertisers-and-adblockers\">2023 report by Ghostery</a>, a provider of privacy-focused software, found that the average website contains 32 tracking scripts, silently collecting data on your browsing behavior. This highlights a crucial fact: <strong>a significant portion of your digital footprint forms without your direct input</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, despite what many people think, managing your digital footprint goes beyond obsessing over your online privacy – it&#8217;s also about protecting your reputation, future opportunities, and personal safety. For example, your online content can <a href=\"https://fama.io/post/social-media-posts-employee-termination\">affect your employment</a> and relationships; it could even make you vulnerable to cybercrime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking to go beyond basic management strategies, this article offers advanced techniques to take control of your online presence. We&#8217;ll explore the potential consequences of an unmanaged digital footprint and provide you with powerful tools and strategies – including <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> – to help you shape and protect your online identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a professional concerned about your online reputation, a privacy-conscious user, or a parent worried about your child&#8217;s digital presence, these strategies will give you the skillset to navigate the Internet with confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7 important steps to manage your digital footprint</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Assess your current digital footprint&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by conducting a thorough digital footprint audit. Search for your name on various search engines and take note of what information appears. Check all your social media profiles, blogs, and websites where you have an account. Pay special attention to old, inactive accounts and consider deleting or deactivating them if you don’t need them anymore. One way to find accounts you might have forgotten about is to search your email inbox for words/derivatives of words like &#8220;Verification&#8221;, &#8220;Activation&#8221;, &#8220;Login&#8221;, etc., things they send when you create a new account</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, evaluate the content you&#8217;ve shared. Does it align with your current personal and professional goals? Look for any outdated or potentially harmful information. This process helps you identify areas for improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you review, note any discrepancies or negative information that could impact your reputation. Make a plan to update, correct, or remove such content. Remember, your digital footprint is dynamic, so we recommend making regular assessments on a monthly or quarterly routine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Adjust privacy settings on social media and other online platforms</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Take control of your online presence by regularly reviewing and updating privacy settings on all your social media platforms. Ensure that only necessary information is visible to the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Limit data sharing by disabling location services and restricting the amount of personal information you share online. Use privacy settings to control who can see your posts and personal information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And don&#8217;t forget to utilize platform-specific tools. For example, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook</a> offers a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/443357099140264\">Privacy Checkup feature</a>, while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\">X (formerly Twitter)</a> provides detailed <a href=\"https://help.x.com/en/safety-and-security\">Privacy and Safety settings</a>. These tools can help you manage your privacy more effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Be mindful of what you share online</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before hitting that &#8216;post&#8217; button, pause and consider the long-term impact of sharing personal details or sensitive information online. Remember, once something is posted, it can be challenging to remove it completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding your audience is crucial. Be aware of who can see your posts and adjust your sharing settings accordingly. You might want to use different privacy settings for different audiences – friends, public, or custom lists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oversharing can lead to serious consequences. It increases your risk of identity theft, unwanted solicitations, and even professional repercussions. A good rule of thumb: <strong>if you wouldn&#8217;t want it on a billboard, don&#8217;t put it online.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Regularly update software and applications</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure all your devices and applications are running the latest versions to protect against security threats. This is important because security updates prevent attacks that lead to data leaks and breaches, and it’s always recommended that you update to the latest privacy policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where possible, enable automatic updates to stay protected without extra effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t stop at updates – use security tools to bolster your defenses. Install and regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software. Firewalls and VPNs can add extra layers of security, helping to keep your online activities private.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, don&#8217;t forget about data backups. Regularly back up important data to prevent loss in case of a security breach. This practice not only protects your information but also gives you peace of mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Monitor your online presence and reputation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay on top of what&#8217;s being said about you online by setting up alerts. Tools like <a href=\"https://www.google.com/alerts?hl=en\">Google Alerts</a> can notify you when <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/04/10/personal-branding-tools/\">your name or brand</a> is mentioned online. This allows you to respond quickly to any mentions, whether positive or negative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make it a habit to periodically search for your name on search engines. This practice gives you a clear picture of what information is publicly available about you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you come across negative or inaccurate information, address it promptly and professionally. In some cases, you might need to contact website administrators to remove harmful content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Showcase your skills and accomplishments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your digital footprint isn&#8217;t just about minimizing risks – it&#8217;s also an opportunity to showcase your best self. Create a professional profile on platforms like <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a> to highlight your skills, experience, and accomplishments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regularly share relevant content that showcases your expertise and interests. This could be articles you&#8217;ve written, projects you&#8217;ve completed, or industry news you find interesting. By doing so, you&#8217;re actively shaping your online presence in a positive way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to engage with your network. Comment on and share posts from others in your field so you can increase your visibility and build valuable professional relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Create a centralized online presence with Gravatar</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1395\" height=\"852\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/gravatar-homepage-1.png\" alt=\"Gravatar homepage\" class=\"wp-image-2290\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar offers a strategic solution for creating a <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/02/21/securing-cyber-space-role-of-digital-identity-verification/\">centralized online identity</a> that’s more consistent with your preferred brand and, crucially, completely in your control. It&#8217;s a service that allows you to create and manage a single profile that can be used across multiple websites and platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it works: You create a profile on Gravatar, storing your information securely. When you interact with Gravatar-enabled websites, they import your data from your Gravatar profile rather than storing it themselves. This approach is highly beneficial for alleviating data privacy concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1032\" height=\"776\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ronnie-gravatar-profile-1.png\" alt=\"Example of a Gravatar profile\" class=\"wp-image-2291\" />\n\n\n\n<p>To get started with Gravatar:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Visit <a href=\"http://gravatar.com\">Gravatar.com</a> and sign up for an account.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1287\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/gravatar-profile-creation.png\" alt=\"Gravatar sing-up process\" class=\"wp-image-2292\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Upload an avatar image.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1635\" height=\"893\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/gravatar-uploading-profile-picture.png\" alt=\"Uploading a profile picture to Gravatar\" class=\"wp-image-2294\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Fill out your profile information.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1628\" height=\"1158\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/gravatar-personal-information.png\" alt=\"Filling out profile information with Gravatar\" class=\"wp-image-2295\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Choose your privacy settings.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"974\" height=\"733\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/gravatar-privacy-settings-1.png\" alt=\"Adjusting the privacy settings in Gravatar\" class=\"wp-image-2296\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"5\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Add more relevant information, such as links, images, interests, and more!&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1613\" height=\"919\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/gravatar-profile-edit-page.png\" alt=\"Gravatar profile editing\" class=\"wp-image-2298\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to remove unwanted content from the internet</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prevention is the best way to go, but you can’t protect yourself from absolutely everything, and chances are there will be some content that ends up somewhere you wished it didn’t. But how do you deal with this issue if you don’t own the website?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a look.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Contact the website owner or content creator</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most direct approach to removing unwanted content is to reach out to the website owner or content creator. When drafting your request, be polite and persuasive. Explain why the content should be removed and how it affects you personally or professionally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a template you can use or adapt:</p>\n\n\n\n<table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Subject: </strong>Request for Content Removal<br /><br />Dear [Website Owner/Content Creator],I hope this email finds you well. <br /><br />I&#8217;m writing to request the removal of [specific content] from your website, which can be found at [URL].This content [explain how it affects you, e.g., &#8220;contains outdated information about me&#8221; or &#8220;is causing harm to my professional reputation&#8221;]. I would greatly appreciate if you could remove or update this information.If you need any additional information from me, please don&#8217;t hesitate to ask. I&#8217;m happy to provide any necessary documentation to support this request.Thank you for your time and consideration.<br /><br />Best regards,[Your Name]</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t receive a response, follow up after a week or two. Be persistent but remain courteous throughout the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Use Google&#8217;s removal tools</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the content appears in Google search results, you can request its removal using <a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/contact/content_removal_form?hl=en\">Google&#8217;s Search Removal Request</a>. While this doesn&#8217;t remove the content from the original website, it can significantly reduce its visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use Google&#8217;s removal request form:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Go to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9673730\">Google&#8217;s Search Console Help</a> page.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"423\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/google-search-removal-page.png?w=660\" alt=\"Google\'s Search Console Help page\" class=\"wp-image-2299\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Click on &#8220;Start removal request.&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"216\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/start-removal-request-button.png?w=660\" alt=\"Request to remove content from Google\" class=\"wp-image-2300\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Fill out the form with the URL of the page you want removed and explain why.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"462\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/search-removal-form-google.png?w=660\" alt=\"Content removal request form\" class=\"wp-image-2301\" />\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Submit the form and wait for Google&#8217;s response.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This method is particularly effective for removing explicit images, fake pornography, or personally identifiable information. However, keep in mind that Google&#8217;s removal process has limitations, and not all requests are granted.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Request de-indexing from search engines</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>De-indexing is the process of removing a webpage from search engine results. While the content remains on the original website, it becomes much harder to find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To request de-indexing:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Contact the website owner and ask them to add a &#8220;noindex&#8221; tag to the specific page.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If the website owner agrees, they&#8217;ll add a line of code to the page&#8217;s HTML that tells search engines not to include it in search results.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This method can be particularly effective for news websites or blogs that may be willing to de-index older articles without removing them entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also do this to your own website by adding &lt;meta name=&#8221;robots&#8221; content=&#8221;noindex&#8221;&gt; to the &lt;head&gt; of the page you don&#8217;t want indexed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Legal options and pre-trial claims</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the content is defamatory or violates your rights, you may need to consider legal options. Always consult with a legal professional before taking this route.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pre-trial claim is a formal request for content removal that can be made before taking legal action. The process varies by jurisdiction but generally involves:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Drafting a formal letter outlining the legal basis for your claim.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sending the letter to the content publisher via certified mail.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Providing a reasonable timeframe for response (usually 14-30 days).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If there&#8217;s no response, consider further legal action.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to research the specific requirements for your country and state if you’re from the US because they will be different. Just to give you a general idea, here’s an <a href=\"https://ilcourtsaudio.blob.core.windows.net/antilles-resources/resources/02189433-b0f5-45cb-8ba7-72bc30289048/Privacy_Act.pdf\">example from the state of Illinois</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for the people in the EU, remember that under the GDPR law, individuals have <a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/?cn-reloaded=1#:~:text=People%E2%80%99s%20privacy%20rights,making%20and%20profiling.\">the right to request their data be deleted</a> from institutions and websites at any time, even if they previously agreed to its presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Leverage online reputation management services</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For particularly challenging cases, consider using Online Reputation Management (ORM) services. These professionals specialize in improving and protecting your online image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reputable ORM services can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Implement strategies to push negative content down in search results.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create and promote positive content about you.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Monitor your online presence continuously.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Provide expert advice on managing your digital footprint.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While these services can be effective, they often come with a significant cost. Research thoroughly and read reviews before engaging in any ORM service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, managing your online presence is an ongoing process. Regular monitoring and proactive management are key to maintaining a positive digital footprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Take control of your digital identity today</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The consequences of neglecting your digital footprint can be severe and long-lasting. From missed job opportunities to identity theft, the risks are real and growing. But armed with the strategies we&#8217;ve discussed, you&#8217;re now equipped to take charge of your online presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, managing your digital footprint is an ongoing process. Start today by conducting a thorough audit of your online presence.

On Friday. <strong>Adam Zielinski</strong> and <strong>Dawid Urbansk</strong>i met with <strong>Ajit Bohra</strong> for an informal discussion about this tool and how it can be integrated into the Playground platform.  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xFjwsC40O7Q\">The recording is now available on YouTube</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Two new blueprints in the Gallery: </strong>ImportStarter Content</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/30/starter-content-for-themes-in-4-7/\">WordPress 4.7</a>, Theme builders could add Starter Content to their themes, to showcase how the theme could shine or to give  users  a head start on building their new site.  Playground offers two methods to import Starter Content: via an <a href=\"https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/blueprints/steps#InstallThemeStep\">option on the installTheme step</a> or as a separate <code>importStarterContent</code> step. The two new examples in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/blueprints/blob/trunk/GALLERY.md\">Blueprint Gallery </a>show how to use both of them. </p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/blueprints/blob/trunk/GALLERY.md\"><img width=\"652\" height=\"202\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-30-at-10.45.10.png?resize=652%2C202&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-31082\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-small-font-size\"><em>Questions?

Automattic case took place yesterday at the Northern California District Court. Presiding Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín made it clear that while she was “inclined to grant some sort of injunction,” WP Engine’s proposed version was “exceedingly vague” and “not particularly narrowly tailored.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The judge emphasized that she could not enforce WP Engine’s proposed injunction due to its lack of specificity. In the meantime, both parties have been ordered to maintain the status quo until December 2, giving them time to submit revised proposals for the injunction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic and Matt Mullenweg were represented by Anna Shaw and her team from Hogan Lovells, while WP Engine was represented by Rachel Herrick Kassabian and her team from Quinn Emanuel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Engine’s counsel <a href=\"https://www.delta.blog/transcript-of-the-preliminary-injunction-hearing/\">asserted</a> their client’s right to operate without the looming threat of a &#8220;nuclear war&#8221; and to remain an integral part of the WordPress community, which they have contributed to for over 15 years. They highlighted the abruptness of Automattic’s actions, pointing out the sudden issuance of a trademark license agreement on September 20—an unprecedented move after years of peaceful coexistence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They told the court, “That&#8217;s not how trademark owners operate. That is not how you protect and enforce your mark. You don&#8217;t wait 15 years and then drop a demand for thirty two million dollars on the recipient.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key issues discussed was Automattic’s demand for 8% of WP Engine’s gross revenue, a sum amounting to $32 million. When questioned, Matt Mullenweg allegedly admitted that this figure was based on WP Engine’s financial capacity, stating, “It’s what I thought they could pay. We did an analysis to figure out what the free cash flow was. That’s how we set that number.” WP Engine’s legal team compared this approach to setting a ransom rather than calculating a reasonable royalty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Engine also claimed Automattic’s actions, including their ban from WordPress.org, have caused significant harm—loss of customers, market share, reputation, and goodwill.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anna Shaw, representing Automattic, countered that WP Engine still has access to WordPress software and plugins. What has been restricted, however, is their ability to use enhanced services provided by WordPress.org, such as hosting, managing, and distributing plugins via the platform. Shaw further stated that WP Engine circumvented this restriction by creating a “mirror” to restore customer functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Engine’s Attorney Brian Mack said the mirror was only a temporary and partial workaround they had to put in place to satisfy their customers. He added that “The WordPress core software, the software that defendants make available on their website, is intimately linked with WordPress.org. There&#8217;s 1500 references in the code. They&#8217;re hard coded references that you cannot change… Every single WordPress installation relies on WordPress.org.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also shared about the huge security vulnerability for all of their clients and Automattic releasing the paid features of ACF pro on WordPress.org under a new URL. But Shaw accused them of wanting to avoid the costs associated with paying for or building an alternative solution.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 18:34:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: #147 – Steve Burge on Transitioning WordPress to the SaaS Market\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=180493\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/147-steve-burge-on-transitioning-wordpress-to-the-saas-market\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38077:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, transitioning WordPress to the SaaS market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Steve Burge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve is behind several popular WordPress plugins, such as PublishPress, MetaSlider, and TaxoPress. And today he&#8217;s here to share his journey, especially his recent ventures into the SaaS, or Software as a Service, landscape with his latest project Logtivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve is experienced in building and marketing WordPress plugins, but Logtivity is different. It&#8217;s a SaaS product aimed at offloading and managing activity logs for WordPress sites, ensuring that the site&#8217;s performance isn&#8217;t bogged down by massive data logs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about how Logtivity started, somewhat serendipitously, through discussions with a UK based developer. Steve recounts how this partnership evolved from a side project into a full-time commitment. He emphasizes the often under appreciated requirements of dedicating undivided attention to a SaaS product, highlighting the challenges and setbacks spaced when juggling other responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key takeaways from Steve&#8217;s journey is the importance of identifying and pivoting to the right niche. Initially targeting large websites with massive data needs, Steve and his team discovered that agencies and maintenance services provided a more stable customer base for Logtivity. This pivot not only helped them understand their market better, but also influence them marketing strategies and pricing models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of pricing, steve touches on the substantial difference between monetizing plugins and SaaS products. A plugin might be a one-time or annual purchase. SaaS services often require higher, recurring monthly fees. This price shift is essential for covering the more considerable operational costs, including uptime guarantees, server maintenance, and robust data handling practices, all of which are critical for a reliable SaaS offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve also discusses the less glamorous side of SaaS development, managing uptime server administration intricacies, and the constant need for vigilance. Unlike plugin development, where a failure might only inconvenience users until they download a fix, SaaS downtime can be catastrophic, especially for services as crucial as those monitoring site activity logs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who&#8217;s navigated this challenging, yet rewarding, path, Steve offers good advice for anyone looking to make a similar transition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a WordPress plugin developer eyeing the SaaS space, or simply curious about the differences between plugin and SaaS development, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Steve Burge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Steve Burge. Hello, Steve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:07] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Hey Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nice to have you with us today. I&#8217;ve spoken with Steve on a number of occasions on different podcasts before. Today we&#8217;re going to be talking about, well, an interesting journey that Steve has had in the WordPress space, and also in the SaaS space. We&#8217;ll find out a little bit about that in a moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before then, Steve, would you mind just giving us your intro? Tell us a little bit about your experiences with WordPress in the past. And maybe you want to just drop some information about this new SaaS thing that you&#8217;ve been wrangling as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:36] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Sure thing. So the most relevant part of my background for this podcast is that we&#8217;re very heavily involved in plugin development. The one we&#8217;re best known for is PublishPress, which tries to solve all sorts of publishing problems with WordPress. But we&#8217;ve got another couple, including MetaSlider, which is a popular slideshow plugin. One called TaxoPress, which organises taxonomy terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s been our background over the last few years. And how that loops into this podcast is we&#8217;ve recently launched a SaaS product called Logtivity, which is basically an activity log for WordPress. It takes all the activity logs, which can get really massive, can accumulate enormous amounts of data, and we&#8217;ll host them for you. So your site isn&#8217;t slowed down, and your database isn&#8217;t plugged up with all this data. And, well, it&#8217;s not been easy, and that&#8217;s kind of the topic of this podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you, that&#8217;s brilliant. So the idea of Logtivity is that it offloads and puts all of that information onto hardware under your control. Because typically WordPress could, if you left everything switched on, presumably it&#8217;s tracking all sorts of information and that could add up to megabytes, and megabytes, and megabytes, and finally gigabytes and terabytes, I guess. Ultimately, if you leave it all there, and you don&#8217;t exactly know what you want to record, or for how long, and what have you. So that&#8217;s what this, product does. We&#8217;ll link to it in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as you said, this podcast is going to be about that journey, that move towards SaaS, and the interesting steps that you would, I guess, possibly do differently. The successes and the failures during that. And you&#8217;ve written down a series of bullet points on the paper near you, and we&#8217;re going to go through those. So this&#8217;ll be fascinating. So firstly, let&#8217;s just go through how it got started. How did you decide that you wanted to create a SaaS?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:26] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> We&#8217;ve acquired some plugins over the years, and during one of the conversations we ended up talking with a developer out of the UK who had an activity log plugin he was looking to sell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It had become a SaaS service and he was working on it slowly by himself, but not really making too much progress. And so it kind of spun out of an acquisition talks with him. And we ended up partnering with him, and both of us were doing it kind of part-time. He had a day job and was putting in a few hours in the evening, and we had our main plugin business and we&#8217;re helping him out a few hours a week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slowly we kind of worked together, almost like a 50 50 partnership. He was doing those few hours on the development, and we were doing a few hours on the documentation and the marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And so you strayed into the idea of doing a SaaS product, contacted this developer in the UK. I&#8217;m guessing from the little bit at the top of the show that everything didn&#8217;t necessarily work out. I don&#8217;t know if it was a collision between you and that developer, or just a whole bunch of other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s embark on your list of things, and they may be a list of ways to do things better in the future. But let&#8217;s go through that with the idea of what it would be like if you were a WordPress plugin developer, or theme developer, or what have you, and you were looking to transition into the SaaS space. Some lessons learned basically from Steve and his team. So go for it. Let&#8217;s start at number one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:49] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Our number one is probably inspired by quite a few conversations we&#8217;ve had. In fact, this whole list is inspired by conversations we&#8217;ve had by people recently, have been interested in adding a SaaS version of their plugin, or launching a whole new SaaS product, looking to expand their WordPress plugin lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve seen some of the demos, I&#8217;ve sat down at WordCamp US, I saw three demos at least, of people with their SaaS products that they&#8217;re working on. And then I&#8217;ve had conversations since then, people trying to spin out an idea. And my first advice to them has been, don&#8217;t do this part-time. It&#8217;s really difficult to make this work as a side hustle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible with a plugin. With a WordPress plugin you can put something on wordpress.org, do some marketing, add some features, and it&#8217;s possible to get some traction. Not easy, but possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s almost impossible with a SaaS service. It requires commitment we&#8217;ve found. We went through a couple of years with this partnership with the UK developer, who became a friend, and I enjoyed working with him, but it didn&#8217;t work with each of us chipping in a few hours a week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is that because of the problems that you&#8217;ve got to try and solve? So obviously with the WordPress plugin, a lot of the bits and pieces that might make up a SaaS are taken care of. So authentication, user management, and all of that, and permissions and those kind of things, they&#8217;re all taken care of and so the plugin just builds off the base of WordPress, which provides a lot of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas I&#8217;m imagining, maybe there are libraries and ways of doing it in a more refined and quick way, but they might not align. Is it something to do with that? Is it the fact that you&#8217;ve taken on a load of work, which you might not have foreseen you need to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:27] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Yes, absolutely. You have to build your own payment gateway, your own authentication, and there are some libraries available. We built Logtivity in Laravel, and there are some drop-in libraries, but it&#8217;s never quite that easy. There are big chunks that you do need to build yourself. You may see some SaaS frameworks out there, but none of them are ever quite as easy as they promise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you are starting from a lower level. There&#8217;s not the ability to suddenly drop in a WooCommerce and have the ability to sell the product. There&#8217;s probably not a licensing system like Easy Digital Downloads, which is ready to drop in and go from the start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so earlier this year we moved to acquire the whole of the plugin finally from our UK partner. And we put a full-time developer on Logtivity, and that&#8217;s when we&#8217;ve really started to see some progress because we underestimated the workload involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so it&#8217;s basically a measurement of the amount of work involved, and also an understanding that there&#8217;s a load of extra work, which you take for granted in a sense, in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess also with WordPress, the end user is fairly well-defined in that they&#8217;re website builder, and they&#8217;re going to have a WordPress website. And you&#8217;ve got the constraints of the system that that brings and all of the different bits and pieces there. So the scope is a little less large.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your audience is defined, they&#8217;re WordPress website owners who are willing to extend the boundaries of WordPress. Whereas I guess with a SaaS, at the beginning at least, from a marketing point of view, you&#8217;re also just sort of shouting into a void. Nobody has heard of you. You might have to start frequenting other social networks, and building some sort of reputation outside of the WordPress space. You can&#8217;t use that marketing channel as well. Yeah, okay, so there&#8217;s a load there. So that&#8217;s number one. Take us through the next few then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:13] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Oh, you kind of hit on number 2 there. The niche is hard to find. In our particular use case, we imagined that the main customers would be, well, very big websites that needed to offload enormous amounts of data. That&#8217;s kind of the origin story of Logtivity, is that there was a customer just like that who had activity logs that were so big they just couldn&#8217;t possibly be downloaded from their own website. They needed to offload it somewhere. And so we thought there were lots more customers out there like that. No, it turned out we&#8217;re probably solving a problem that maybe dozens of people had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the assumption being that there&#8217;d be loads of end users with this problem, and I guess that&#8217;s one of market research and asking the question, is there anybody out there who would use this thing? I mean, you&#8217;re obviously pursuing the solution, Logtivity continues. Have you pivoted who the target audience is? Maybe you&#8217;re addressing, I don&#8217;t know, the hosting space or something like that instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:05] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> We&#8217;ve pivoted more towards agencies. Our biggest users are agencies who have hundreds of customers, and they need an easy way to track what&#8217;s happening on all those sites. Agencies and maintenance services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The niche problem has come up with quite a few of the people I&#8217;ve talked to who have been kicking around SaaS ideas. They put up a site with AI content marketing, or one particular WordPress plugin niche, and it&#8217;s tricky to hit that niche, not only a niche that people will pay for initially, but also one that gives you room to grow into the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting isn&#8217;t it, because you&#8217;re separating people from an amount of money, which a typical WordPress plugin can manage is one thing, but SaaS products seem to, over the course of a year at least anyway, my intuition is that they&#8217;re more expensive. And trying to get people to open up their wallet and pay for something like that, yeah, you&#8217;ve got to know who those people are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re right, if in the beginning it was an end user who was building a website, it&#8217;s probably the least interesting thing in their day thinking about activity logs and what have you. Whereas it really does solve a problem for a development agency who&#8217;s trying to track down a problem on a WordPress website that they have access to, and that they are in charge of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So pivoting that, and learning that was probably extremely important. It makes you wonder at the beginning, imagine the amount of time you could save if you&#8217;d just been able to draw that conclusion, and figure out who the actual perfect target market was. So that&#8217;s an important thing to mention. Thank you for that. What came next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:39] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Oh, well, you&#8217;re picking my brain. Number three, again, which is, the prices are higher. You are working with a substantially different pricing segment. If you&#8217;re selling a plugin, you&#8217;re probably, even something big like Gravity Forms, the initial pricing option is about $50 a year, and not unusual tool for SaaS services to be that per month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Logtivity, I actually have a list of all our products on the whiteboard behind me, and one of the details is how much people are paying us each month on average. With our plugins, the average is between $5 and $10 a month, which would be hard to make a SaaS service work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Logtivity, the average is closer to $20. So we&#8217;re already at a pricing segment which is twice where we are with our plugins. We hope to keep growing that because to run a successful SaaS, you probably need to be aiming at a pricing level that is three, four times what you&#8217;re charging for your plugins. And to do that, you need to add a lot more value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s interesting. I&#8217;ve never really heard anybody encapsulate that as that fraction, you know, or that multiple, three or four times is what you need to be at, in ballpark figures to make it profitable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess that comes down to the requirements of a SaaS product. You&#8217;ve got actual hardware that you&#8217;ve got to manage, you&#8217;ve got servers that need to be up. Whereas a WordPress plugin, you have a zip file that you need to put somewhere. And that typically could be on some extremely inexpensive hosting option. Very typical hosting option out in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a SaaS option, you need to have a much more complicated, robust setup. And also, I guess, you&#8217;re into the realms of sort of GDPR, and data handling, and maintaining all of that as well. Okay, that&#8217;s interesting. So I think that was three. Let&#8217;s move over to four.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:27] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Those last couple of minutes, you basically knocked off all the rest of the items on my list. I&#8217;ll go through them in more detail. I put this on Twitter, slash X, as a question last week, and the very first response I got was from one of the founders of GiveWP. And his was basically one word reply, it was uptime. That is all your responsibility now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a plugin developer, like you say, you give them the plugin package and then it&#8217;s all in the customer&#8217;s hands. But when you&#8217;re running a SaaS service, that uptime is all on you. You need to be there 99.9% of the time. And if that happens on a Sunday morning, you have downtime, Saturday night when you&#8217;re out with your family and you had a drink or two, and you have downtime problems, it&#8217;s a whole different experience from running a plugin where you can offload almost all of that worry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I guess the nature of the data that you are gathering in particular means that downtime is really not an option. You can be kind of forgiving of some SaaS apps if they go down, because the nature of the work that you are doing in there is not really that crucial or time sensitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if your consumption of log data stalls, then you&#8217;ll just have this big black hole. And then people come because their site, they want to track something down that happened at the exact coincidental moment that your hardware failed, you&#8217;re in a bit of bother, aren&#8217;t you? And you&#8217;ve got to promise something like 99.9, or even potentially higher, given the nature of the data that you are gathering. So yeah, that&#8217;s really interesting. Uptime suddenly becomes a really important thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:00] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> I&#8217;ve been thinking about some of these successful SaaS&#8217; that we&#8217;ve had out of the WordPress community. You have Metorik, the WooCommerce product that Bryce from Australia developed. He&#8217;s taking in WooCommerce data and suddenly, you have downtime, you miss a couple of sales. Suddenly your key WooCommerce revenue data is off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or perhaps the most popular niche has been backup services. Backup slash maintenance services like ManageWP or BlogVault. You&#8217;re dealing with critical information there when it comes to people&#8217;s site backups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yes, uptime is a whole new headache that you have to learn to deal with, when you&#8217;re dealing with SaaS as opposed to plugin development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, so the typical plugin developer can happily go out, as you described it, on a Saturday night, and have a few drinks, knowing that if something goes wrong with the website, at the very most, people are going to be unable to access the latest version of the software, possibly the support forums, or whatever that may be. You can be fairly forgiving of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if your SaaS goes down on Saturday night and you&#8217;ve had a few drinks, suddenly you are faced with this bit of a dilemma really, isn&#8217;t it? Do you try to fix it? You&#8217;re just miles away from a telephone, or an internet connection, or whatever it may be. You&#8217;re out in the back of beyond, camping with your family or something like that, and suddenly all the bets are off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I presume it&#8217;s incumbent upon you to set up a much more robust structure of people who are managing that. So it can&#8217;t just be Steve. It&#8217;s got to be Steve plus one other who is available when Steve is not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:34] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Yes, whenever I&#8217;ve talked to someone about this, it&#8217;s been a relief for them to get that first hire down so it&#8217;s not just them. They can occasionally take some time off, but you need a different skillset that you either need to learn yourself, or you need to hire, which is server admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The knock on effect of worrying about uptime is you need to get familiar with diving into Google Cloud consoles, or Amazon S3 consoles. Poking around into at least moderate level server admin skills to be able to get your SaaS up and running. As Laravel users, there are some nice options. We use Laravel Vapor, which is a pretty robust option that takes quite a bit of the server admin headache away from us, but definitely not all of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, and I guess the key thing that I got out of what you just said there was the first hire is the bit where you suddenly feel a sense of relief, because it&#8217;s no longer just on your shoulders. Not just in terms of server management and the technicalities of learning how to do that, but just that on 24 hours a day, the nature of just never being able to entirely switch off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mean, it&#8217;s just ordinary things like planning a regular weekend and going out, and knowing that at some point the telephone could ring and you need to be within earshot of that telephone. You&#8217;ve got to make sure that you are on the internet somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I guess also you need to set up sort of standard SOP things. So, okay, if our uptime monitoring software alerts to the fact that our SaaS is down, what do we do? Who&#8217;s taking it? Where does the chain of command go? What&#8217;s the pre-written email that we&#8217;re going to send out to our customers, and all of those kind of things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:12] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> More than one time ourselves, or our UK partner, was tapping away frantically on our phones trying to reboot a server, or get things working when we weren&#8217;t in the office. These things happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve tried to have people with a variety of skills help out with Logtivity because when it comes to hiring a WordPress plugin developer, it&#8217;s normally been fairly straightforward. If you&#8217;re a good PHP developer, or even if you&#8217;re adjacent to PHP, our last hire with our plugin shop was someone with JavaScript experience, and they&#8217;ve really had no problem adjusting to be a WordPress plugin developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with a SaaS service, you&#8217;re looking for someone who knows WordPress, because if you are interacting between your SaaS and WordPress, they need to know the normal WordPress standards. Plus, it helps in a big way, obviously, to know the platform you&#8217;re working with. It could be Node.js, it could be Laravel. And then you have the server admin on top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s not surprising to me that some of the people who have successfully started SaaS&#8217;, they 10 X developers, incredibly talented people. I think we discussed Bryce Adams from Metorik. There&#8217;s another guy doing well, Aaron Edwards, who has an AI documentation service called DocsBot. And it requires, certainly as the founder or the initial developer, to really be able to have a good understanding, across multiple areas, from your own SaaS platform, to WordPress, to server admin, and whatever else might be needed to keep your SaaS service going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, great. Really interesting stuff coming out of this. And it&#8217;s really sparking my thought process because each time you describe the next bullet point, it definitely leads me into a thought process that I hadn&#8217;t had before. And so this is really interesting. So where do we go next? What&#8217;s the next one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:54] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> To wrap up what we&#8217;ve done, we said that uptime is a major issue, it&#8217;s on you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Server admin is a key skill that you&#8217;re going to need to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technical challenge is wide ranging, that. You may have to deal with several new areas, not just your own SaaS stack, but also the server admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the technical challenge itself is different coming from a very defined framework like WordPress. People joke that as a WordPress developer you basically make it up and do it your own way. When they start looking at other people&#8217;s plugin code and think, what kind of weird non-standard thing have you done here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the truth is, most people working in WordPress are working in a pretty closely defined framework. A lot is given to you including the authentication, for example, a lot of the database structure. If you are building a SaaS service, either for good or bad, that&#8217;s on you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We kind of touched on that point earlier, but I didn&#8217;t mention the one, I put this question on Twitter, this was probably the most common response I got, that you&#8217;re on your own. I got responses from people who had used Node. People who&#8217;d used Rails. People who had used Laravel, all sorts of different products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They all said that adjusting to that freedom was perhaps the most interesting challenge for them. I&#8217;ve been quite big on mentioning the difficulties so far, but in terms of being a learning experience, in terms of being something completely new, it&#8217;s a whole different mindset moving from working in WordPress to working inside one of these SaaS frameworks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned the sort of, I think you described it as, it&#8217;s all on you. I wonder if basically you&#8217;re saying it&#8217;s quite a lonely thing to do. Because the WordPress community is kind of famously large, and famously accommodating, let&#8217;s put it that way. People who have really competing products do manage to be able to just put their differences to one side, and the profit motive to one side when they gather at things like WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m just guessing, but I&#8217;m guessing that the SaaS space is probably a little bit less, and I would imagine there&#8217;s a little bit more of a cutthroat mentality. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s true or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:01] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> It&#8217;s certainly, you&#8217;re coming across more unique problems. Problems that are unique to your build. Problems that are unique to what you are trying to do. Which maybe only a handful of people have experienced, and if they have, they probably haven&#8217;t put it onto a forum, onto Stack Overflow or somewhere for other people to find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I can guarantee 99%, if I run across a WordPress problem, I&#8217;ll be able to Google it and find the answer because the problems are probably fairly limited. It&#8217;s a clearly defined product, a clearly defined framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before coming on the show, a customer had a problem with uploading images. They couldn&#8217;t upload an image that was larger than like 2,500 pixels. I hadn&#8217;t heard of that as a problem before. A quick Google search. Oh, it was something that was introduced in WordPress in 5.3. We come across similar problems in our SaaS service, there&#8217;s no Google results, there&#8217;s no search results. For good or bad, we are figuring it out by ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So yeah, every time there&#8217;s a support request that you don&#8217;t fully understand, Google is your friend in the WordPress space, because it&#8217;s very likely that somebody has had that exact same problem before. A perfect example with the image uploads, and it was just, it had never come across your door before. But then it did, and you were able to find the answer in fairly short measure, I would&#8217;ve thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the notion that if that&#8217;s a problem on your own hardware, in your own SaaS, well, you&#8217;re on your own. Go and figure that out. And I guess there is a bit of that, you&#8217;ve got to figure out all of the different bits and pieces, and be fairly self-reliant. And in the back at the same time, being able to manage the stress that causes. And obviously if you&#8217;re in the process of building, and it&#8217;s not yet profitable, or if you&#8217;ve built it, shipped it, and it&#8217;s not yet, every one of those is one of the death by a thousand paper cuts kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:37] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Oh, for sure. There&#8217;s a learning curve to this, and it takes time. In the blog post that I put together, putting all these lessons together, I dug into the success stories of a couple of people that have really made a success of their WordPress connected SaaS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of them, the two founders took a couple of years without pay to get it started. Bryce with Metorik took about a year to leave his job from Automattic and get to a comfortable level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a big change from having a comfortable job, or running an existing business to get some things like this up and running. It&#8217;s probably a fulltime commitment for at least a year, if you&#8217;re lucky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And you&#8217;ve got to be able to bankroll that. And there&#8217;s going to be some expenses that you hadn&#8217;t foreseen. And it&#8217;s not just a case of giving people a zip file. There&#8217;s a whole lot more going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gosh, that&#8217;s really fascinating. I suppose the one question that I want to ask is, if you had your time again, would you even embark upon a SaaS at this point, combined with WordPress? Would Logtivity be something that you&#8217;d examine and think, you know what, maybe not?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:38] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> We were kicking around this question after having these conversations recently. It may be that we have some extra features coming soon. We&#8217;re going to see how those go, and it may be time for another pivot, including perhaps wrapping it into one of our existing products with an existing customer base. Some of our successful plugins have thousands and thousands of users. It may be that something like this is better picked up, is better sold, to an existing customer base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess that&#8217;s an interesting point as well in that WordPress, the sky is set at a certain height maybe with WordPress. And if you have an absolute barnstormer of a SaaS product, and we can all imagine ones which we&#8217;ve all used before, Slack may be a good example, something like Notion or something like that. Ones that lots of people have heard of but didn&#8217;t necessarily exist all that long ago. I guess in the case of Slack, it probably has.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But really the sky is miles away. There is no limit. So if you were to be successful, it has a greater opportunity to turn it into something truly inspirational, groundbreaking. You can do whatever you like. You&#8217;re not constrained, in air quotes, by the WordPress backbone of it all. So, yeah, you would do it again, I&#8217;m taking it from that. But you maybe would&#8217;ve done things slightly differently, and pivoted it, and changed the direction of it a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:00] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Oh yeah. Just as a learning experience. You&#8217;re in this business to make money obviously, but to learn as well and try new challenges. And out of the 20 odd years that I&#8217;ve been doing things in this industry, I would put launching a SaaS product right up there with the very toughest. I&#8217;ve learned more doing this than just about anything else I&#8217;ve done in those last 20 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That seems like a perfect place to end it. Steve Burge, thank you so much for chatting to me today. Really appreciate it. Just before we go, where can people find you, apart from Logtivity? We&#8217;ll link to that in the show notes on wptavern.com. Where else might we find you? Do you hang out on any socials, or anything like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:42] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Yeah, I am stevejburge on most of those, Twitter / Threads / Bluesky platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, thank you very much, Steve. Really appreciate that. And hopefully people will reach out if they&#8217;ve got some interesting conversations to have with you about turning WordPress into SaaS. Thank you very much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:03] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Thanks Nathan. I don&#8217;t want to discourage anyone. We&#8217;ve had lots of conversations about people launching their own SaaS, and I&#8217;ve tried to be encouraging. It&#8217;s a difficult path, but a worthwhile path. And hopefully anyone who reads our blog post will get some good advice from the WordPress community. And I hope they have good luck in launching their product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> As I said, we will put all of the links in the show notes. Head to wptaven.com and search for the episode with Steve Burge. We&#8217;ll link to the blog post there. But once again, Steve, thank you so much for chatting to me today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:36] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Cheers Nathan.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://x.com/stevejburge\">Steve Burge</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve is behind several popular WordPress plugins such as PublishPress, MetaSlider, and TaxoPress, and today, he’s here to share his journey, especially his recent ventures into the SaaS (Software as a Service) landscape with his latest project, Logtivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve is experienced in building and marketing WordPress plugins, but Logtivity is different. It’s a SaaS product aimed at offloading and managing activity logs for WordPress sites, ensuring that the site’s performance isn&#8217;t bogged down by massive data logs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about how Logtivity started, somewhat serendipitously, through discussions with a UK-based developer. Steve recounts how this partnership evolved from a side project into a full-time commitment. He emphasises the often underappreciated requirement of dedicating undivided attention to a SaaS product, highlighting the challenges and setbacks faced when juggling other responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key takeaways from Steve’s journey is the importance of identifying and pivoting to the right niche. Initially targeting large websites with massive data needs, Steve and his team discovered that agencies and maintenance services provided a more stable customer base for Logtivity. This pivot not only helped them understand their market better, but also influenced their marketing strategies and pricing models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of pricing, Steve touches on the substantial difference between monetising plugins and SaaS products. A plugin might be a one-time or annual purchase, SaaS services often require higher, recurring monthly fees. This price shift is essential for covering the more considerable operational costs, including uptime guarantees, server maintenance, and robust data handling practices, all of which are critical for a reliable SaaS offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve also discusses the less glamorous side of SaaS development, managing uptime, server administration intricacies, and the constant need for vigilance. Unlike plugin development, where a failure might only inconvenience users until they download a fix, SaaS downtime can be catastrophic, especially for services as crucial as those monitoring site activity logs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who&#8217;s navigated this challenging, yet rewarding, path, Steve offers good advice for anyone looking to make a similar transition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a WordPress developer eyeing the SaaS space, or simply curious about the differences between plugin and SaaS development, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2

This plugin has 90+ active installations and exhibits the features of ACF Pro plugin like repeater, flexible content, clone fields gallery, options pages, and ACF Blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month, WordPress.org took over WP Engine’s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/acf-plugin-forked-to-secure-custom-fields-plugin\">ACF plugin</a>, citing security issues, and renamed it Secure Custom Fields (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/\">https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/</a>)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/wordpressdotorg/#content-plugins\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdG5ci3dsl4eq2juxOPWSbe9sSpIu5BDegGunmxwkFHIs5gwsp7gxgDuyXaSkuNbfHsNTSLmQDpn3pDJ0jrP0sy9oZg06gtCOEIrR5MVz1ihTUnmVTAu5YoKmVt0qJWhSAuixgK2A?key=8Nc8VCiXWQM5XY5o8QO15iVY\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>David McCan from WebTNG, has a detailed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYHKSpfhrRE\">video</a> analyzing the new plugin. He shares that the update check and license check functionality from ACF Pro has been removed. He remarked “This seems like a classic case of a null plugin which is now being hosted in the WordPress plug-in directory. So I&#8217;m wondering if this is even a legal Fork. I&#8217;m not an expert in software licensing law but my understanding is you need to preserve the original copyright notices when you fork a plugin. it&#8217;s one of the requirements.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prominent voices have weighed in on the controversy. Gergely Orosz of The Pragmatic Engineer newsletter <a href=\"https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1860965378123239921\">tweeted</a>, “Automattic &#8211; the creator of WordPress, a company raising $950M in VC funding &#8211; took a paid WordPress plugin built and owned by another dev and re-published it, making it free. If you have a business selling a paid WP plugin: Automattic can null it, anytime. Another new low.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duane Storey <a href=\"https://x.com/DuaneStorey/status/1861069617294172572\">shared</a> in X that ACF is now “an officially registered trademark of WP Engine.” He also <a href=\"https://x.com/DuaneStorey/status/1860443216367219060\">said</a>, &#8220;Sounds like what&#8217;s being put into the WordPress repository is basically a nulled version of ACF Pro without some of the copyrights.&nbsp; It&#8217;s clear Matt&#8217;s no longer a champion of any of the things he once said he was.&nbsp; I left a review. “</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Brugman, a Full-Stack Developer, <a href=\"https://x.com/Brugman/status/1860672554966393291\">pointed out</a>, “A8c&#8217;s _new_ SCF plugin deactivates Advanced Custom Fields PRO when it is activated. An action that is not allowed by the dot org Plugin Handbook.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattician Brandon Kraft, who submitted the plugin, addressed the issue on <a href=\"https://religious.social/@kraft/113539565935870350\">Mastodon</a>, “The decisions on forking ACF or ACF Pro, etc., are above my paygrade, so to speak, but I didn&#8217;t refuse to work on it because I wanted to try to do it right/better.” He also shared, “I wasn&#8217;t involved in the forking the Pro code, but I just don&#8217;t see a notice. One item on my list is create a proper LICENSE.md that includes the GPL and ack past copyright…acknowledging it is built on existing work. If I missed the copyright already in the code, that&#8217;s an oversight on my part and not intentional.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Repository <a href=\"https://www.therepository.email/wordpress-org-forks-acf-pro-in-unprecedented-move-against-wp-engine\">reported</a> that a member of the WordPress Plugin Review Team, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that after Kraft submitted the ACF Pro fork, it was approved by another Automattic employee, bypassing the Plugin Review Team’s usual processes and checks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The incident has sparked heated discussions on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1gy8bud/wordpressorg_has_apparently_released_secure/\">Reddit</a> too. While the majority is against WordPress.org’s action, some <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1h05vfy/why_i_will_be_using_scf_instead_of_acf/\">support</a> getting the pro features for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The preliminary injunction hearing for WP Engine vs Automattic is scheduled for later today. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:32:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 14.3.1 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=335742\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://buddypress.org/2024/11/buddypress-14-3-1-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2341:\"<p id=\"block-35e8c6a5-dc8c-4b4a-b459-aa739313f8ca\"><a href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/buddypress.14.3.1.zip\">BuddyPress 14.3.1</a> is now available.

In today&#8217;s episode we&#8217;ll talk about Gutenberg 19.6, 19.7, developer hours, playground and collaborative editing. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source project sponsored by Automattic. With me today is the brilliant Anne McCarthy, product manager for WordPress and author of the Source of Truth posts that she&#8217;s keeping for almost over a year. No, two years maybe. Forgot. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Might be almost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Hi, Anne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: It&#8217;s been a long time. Yeah. Hello. Thank you so much for having me. And also I feel like it&#8217;s like a lucky, I don&#8217;t know, 1, 1, 1, 1. I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m into that 111. That feels good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah. I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s over 100 episodes, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy: </em>That&#8217;s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s amazing. All the co-hosts that I had and special guests, it was really, it&#8217;s quite a trip. And I&#8217;m still excited and people are listening to it even more. And so, this is my shout-out for all the new listeners on the podcast. And if you want to, please, please leave a review, whatever you feel about the show, it definitely helps with the distributions. Anne, while 6.7 came out, you did a masterwork of Source of Truth. Can you pick up two features that you are most excited about from this release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Oh, yeah, that&#8217;s tough. Yeah, two features. I am very biased by the things that improve the experience and the feedback that we heard back when I was running the FSC outreach program. That&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m always thinking about. And so for me, I would pull out, zoom out. I think zooming out and being able to build with patterns, one of the big issues that we used to have back in the day was that it was hard to find the discoverability of patterns and to work with pattern&#8217;s a lot easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think the potential of zoom out, I think there&#8217;s a lot of things that we need to figure out still. But I think the potential of zoom out and the ability to zoom out and focus on the sections of your site, to get out the granular details is a huge win and something that can be built upon and used contextually right at the moment when you need it. I think that&#8217;s the part that we need to start sorting through is do we now expose this when it comes to adding a new page or adding a new template? Because I know some folks really don&#8217;t like that pop up of starter patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m always fascinated by how we can make the pattern experience easier and make the site building experience for folks who need it a bit more approachable and more section by section. I&#8217;m really, really excited about it. I just built a site for someone recently, a podcast I really like. And that&#8217;s one of the things I was most excited to show her is like, &#8220;Hey, if you want to add future stuff, look, you can just, boom, sections. Add this in, you can just add these patterns.&#8221; And I think it makes the user experience a lot better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other one I&#8217;ll mention is more technical, but something that also has been a long-standing point of feedback back. Back when I was doing developer relations, developer advocacy, the template registration API, I remember early on so many plugin authors being like, &#8220;How do we adopt block templates? How does this work? How do we register things?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I would send very niche GitHub links to how other folks had done it. And this registration API just eases all of that. And I&#8217;m really excited for folks to increase the adoption of using block themes and block templates and embracing a block world. And I am thrilled that that has landed in 6.7. And I hope more and more folks can take advantage of it. Those are the two very different, but I would say those are the two that make me excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Excellent. Excellent. Yeah, we talked about 6.7 with other hosts here before because it&#8217;s an eight to nine weeks release cycle. In between we had our episodes and we looked at that. But we are looking to the future. We have right now on the Make Core blog, we have two posts. One is the release schedule proposal by Héctor Prieto for next year and I can&#8217;t believe we are going to have a 7.0 release in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.8 is proposed to be scheduled for April 15th, 6.9 for August 5th and 7.0 for November 11. And it&#8217;s all around the flagship word camps, around some holidays and way before Black Friday the new version is out. Even those who experienced a lot of traffic for the last two months of the year, they can do it with a new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also for WordPress 6.8, the call for volunteers is out, so if you want to contribute to a release, it is definitely a certain advanced level of contributing. But what you can do, even if you don&#8217;t have experience, you can shadow people that are on the release. To maybe do that and then start working in the release squad for 6.9. Definitely try and figure that out if you want to contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, there are multiple other ways to contribute to WordPress course. We all have done it. We all did some documentation changes, we did some reports on the Gutenberg and the track tickets we tested with that. And testing has become really fun now with Playground. Yeah, it&#8217;s really interesting to see how that sped up so much. Any thoughts about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Playground</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Yeah, I am super&#8230; It&#8217;s so interesting when I had a call this week with some of the WordPress YouTubers, an AMA with Matías Ventura, the project architects of Gutenberg. And Playground is something I&#8217;m so fascinated by because it really does make it immediately accessible. You immediately can have your hands on it and it works well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Playground, one of the things I love about the Playground team, and this is something I think that&#8217;s really important when you&#8217;re using a new tech like that, they want to hear what would make your experience better, easier, if you run into a bug, all that sort of stuff. You&#8217;re getting&#8230; We report stuff all the time. I feel like that&#8217;s one of the things that I really love about these efforts right now in the WordPress project is there&#8217;s so much momentum and so much care and thought being put into those tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so if you haven&#8217;t given it a try, please give it a try. If you&#8217;ve run into an issue, please, there&#8217;s a GitHub repo where you can open issues. But I&#8217;m really hoping we can get more educators and influencers using it to help bring WordPress to more people. If you haven&#8217;t been paying attention to WordPress Playground, I definitely encourage you to do so. And it&#8217;s a great way to test things early. As Birgit was saying, testing is a lot easier and more approachable thanks to a lot of the stuff that&#8217;s being done there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always find it a great way to, whenever I&#8217;m doing the Source of Truth, I&#8217;m spinning up WordPress Playground constantly. I think there&#8217;s some stat where I think 700,000 people have used WordPress Playground. I&#8217;m probably 50,000 of those. Because I feel like I&#8217;m using it probably on a daily basis, so if that&#8217;s helpful insight for&#8230; I truly probably use it on a daily basis. If you aren&#8217;t, it&#8217;s definitely something to add to your list of tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Definitely. Yeah. If you want to learn more about Playground, we are planning some Hallway Hangouts. Hallway Hangouts are informal discussions with contributors on their new features and what they&#8217;re working on to give a little bit feedback but also to show off a few things to trigger some creativity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s Ajit Bohra who is a early adopter of Gutenberg as well as a Gutenberg contributor, has built a blueprint builder. Blueprints are the configuration files for Playground. And he made this into a block editor feature and had been working on it. And so next week, February&#8230; February, how did this come in? No, it&#8217;s Friday, not February, it&#8217;s Friday, November 29th at 14:00 UTC we are in a Playground Hallway Hangout with Ajit Bohra. And he shows off what he has done, what his vision is, what the team is going to think about. Adam Zielinski who was the sole developer for a year now has the whole team behind Playground will also be there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second event is with Tammie Lister and discussing how agencies can use Playground for their product, in their client work and all that. That&#8217;s December 6th, also 14:00. These are save the date for you right now. We are publishing that on the Make Blog on Playground before with all the Zoom links, but that&#8217;s just to get it out before that happens. And you know about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a developer hour coming up on December 17th that&#8217;s also on Playground and watch the announcement on meetup.com. It is not quite clear what the topic is about, but it&#8217;s definitely on the roster. December 17th for 16:00 UTC. And this week was a developer hangout. No, next week, I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m getting my weeks mixed up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> So much is happening. I don&#8217;t blame you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. December 3rd there is a 16:00 at 16:00 UTC. Ryan Welcher will talk about improving your workflows with WordPress development tools. It&#8217;s about extensions, it&#8217;s about create block, it&#8217;s about create block theme, it&#8217;s about webpack and all the different things that can make your life easier. That&#8217;s also sniffers for coding standards and all that. You will learn how to use them and how to make it easier for you to develop things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week what I wanted to say was the recording of the developer hours is available on Exploring the Block Bindings API from WordPress 6.7 with Justin Tadlock and Nick Diego. They just had the block bindings actually my favorite thing for 6.7 that it&#8217;s in the UI and you can connect your custom fields with the blocks and have an automatic display on the front end that&#8217;s just phenomenal and is really magic for me. But that&#8217;s what you can see in that recording.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Contributions<strong> </strong>and Developer Hours<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Now the announcements. The developer blog has some new things there since we last talked about it. Of course, the What&#8217;s New for Developers comes out every 10th of the month. And that covers a lot of things from 6.7 but also from the 19.6 release that we are going to talk about today. And we have a new post format on the developer blog called Snippet, which is a small explanation of a problem solution for one task and then the code snippet with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two snippets there right now. One is how to disable heading levels in the editor. That&#8217;s about a feature that came with 6.7 as well is different heading levels and how you can control that. When you have your editors and they are not supposed to use H1s, you can disable that from the drop-down list. And you can also say, &#8220;Okay, we don&#8217;t do H5 and we don&#8217;t do H6,&#8221; and disable that. And the snippet shows you how to do that very easily with BHP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other one is to conditionally unregistered patterns. That&#8217;s important for theme developers who have patterns for plugins that might not be installed yet. You don&#8217;t want to show the pattern because it runs into a problem. Now you know how to conditionally unregister those patterns and both by Justin Tadlock. All right. That&#8217;s from the developer hours to developer news. And from the upcoming events, the Hallway Hangouts and developer hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> I love all the formats that are happening. There&#8217;s so many learning opportunities and I really liked the new snippet approach. I saw that coming up and I think that&#8217;s a really neat way for folks to get bite-size&#8230; The tutorials are so cool. I followed some of them to learn. And the snippets I think really round it out. Kudos all around. I think it&#8217;s just awesome how much&#8230; I&#8217;ve never&#8230; In my opinion years ago, I think this is the dream. If we had to be able to see how much stuff was going on, it&#8217;s just amazing how many resources there are and ways to either watch live or watch later and learn with other people. It&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And we will also bring the developer hours recordings into the developer blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s on my list for the last thing that I&#8217;m going to do this year is to create the custom post type and figure out how we lay it out and what additional information is going to be around the embedded videos. But yeah, it&#8217;s such a great tool. And we are all working towards the extenders who try to use the new APIs, be it interactivity API, the block bindings or even the block hooks that came out in 6.6 and 6.5. There&#8217;s always something&#8230; And especially also using block themes with the style variations. And so the developer blog is now a&#8230; It&#8217;s been around two years this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And we have about 50 posts. And this definitely enriches it because not everybody has time to read 3,000-word tutorials when they&#8217;re looking for something. Yeah. Yeah. And if you have any ideas, dear listeners, about what should be written about, you can always come in into the core-dev-blog channel in WP Slack and the Make Slack and figure out how that is. There&#8217;s on the website there&#8217;s also how to contribute, how you go from idea to post if you want to write for it. Yeah, definitely. You can also subscribe to it so you never miss a post again with <a href=\"http://developer.wordpress.org/news/subscribe\">developer.wordpress.org/news/subscribe</a> and put in your email address and you get notification.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.7 and 6.7.1<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to what&#8217;s released. And we talked about WordPress 6.7. We have in the show notes for you the field guide 6.7 and also Anne McCarthy&#8217;s WordPress 6.7 Source of Truth published on the Gutenberg Times. But I mention it also because this week WordPress 6.7.1 was released and it fixed a few bugs that okay, those needed to be really done fast because there was a fatal error or the editor didn&#8217;t work right when you had uncategorized pattern browsing or there was a TypeScript error on the categories for theme patterns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Was an auto-size issue with lazy loading and that was a big one that we saw. I saw a lot of reports of across many different areas. And so that will be fixed and yeah, I&#8217;m excited. I&#8217;m really kudos to everyone who worked on that. It&#8217;s a huge&#8230; It&#8217;s one thing you race to the finish line to get the big major release out and then to do another point release. It&#8217;s just really impressive and a lot of effort from a lot of folks in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And that&#8217;s just nine days after the release of 6.7, so that&#8217;s really kudos to the release leads. There was Jonathan Desrosiers and Carlos Bravo who pushed this all over the finish line with the contributors that actually fixed the bugs. But now some of them is in the upcoming Gutenberg releases we&#8217;re going to talk about.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 19.6</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us to Gutenberg 19.6. 194 PRs with 57 contributors, eight were first timers. Kudos to them getting their badges for core contributing there as well. It has 37 enhancement, 65 bug fixes was the one that was released right before release candidate to get all the bugs in. And the rest is always on documentation, tooling, code, quality and components. Let&#8217;s dive in. What&#8217;s first on the list?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, yeah, there are two things that I want to talk about for the developers. The great block scaffolding tool has a new flag. It&#8217;s called Dash dash target dir, to allow the tool to also target where the scaffold should be placed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were some conventions that you had to call the command line outside the plugins in the plugins repo to get a next folder into the repo to where your blocks are created. And now you are in more control of where you can place the new block or a new series of blocks with a scaffolding tool. That was a major request from developers that that might be added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the other one is with wp-scripts, you can now also do a root folder argument for the plugin zip command, so you get your plugins packaged. And that&#8217;s in the right folder or from the right folder. That&#8217;s better there. I want to point that out for the developers on the show using the tools that are built into Gutenberg. Do you want to take the Block Libraries B list?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah, let&#8217;s run through that. I love block library updates because it&#8217;s amazing how just slowly chipping away at stuff, whenever I&#8217;m doing a Source of Truth, I always find there&#8217;s a beautiful set of things that have just big and small tools like 6.7 had shadow support for the group block, which folks really wanted. And it&#8217;s just amazing how the improvements continue to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a transformation from separator to spacer blocks. And that just allows whenever you&#8217;re using the transform menu to easily switch between things. I think that&#8217;s a great one. I think it makes a lot of sense. I actually am really&#8230; Whenever I was looking for the changelog for this, I was excited to see it. I ran into that maybe three weeks ago and so it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, this is an obvious one to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But adding the lightbox option in the gallery block link control. I actually used this. When did I write a blog post? Three days ago? Whenever you add a gallery block before you had to individually select each image block within it to add that lightbox and the lightbox is when the image takes over the screen. And now there&#8217;s just a control at the top level. When you&#8217;re selecting the gallery block, go into the block toolbar, hit the link, and you can easily just have it applied to all the images. Which yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Such a relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yes, it&#8217;s a relief that it&#8217;s perfect&#8230; Yeah, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, this makes perfect sense. Why didn&#8217;t we have this before? I love when that sort of stuff comes out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Not everyone has just three pictures in the gallery. Some people have 20 pictures in the gallery. And then it&#8217;s really…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> And it&#8217;s funny. Yeah, I was like, &#8220;When did we add this?&#8221; Because I literally&#8230; Yeah, that&#8217;s something I cannot tell you how many times I have gone through and manually added that. Or I&#8217;ll miss one image by accident and not realize it. This just makes it so much easier for the archives. There is now border block support, which is great for block theme authors. Border support is also added to comments. Just again, more styling options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cover block has image resolution options now, which is just again, more control to more having commonality between every image block. And this is something I think about a lot whenever you&#8217;re working with blocks that interact with media is like, how can we make it as similar as possible When you&#8217;re working with image things? Because that is an inconsistency that it wears on you when you&#8217;re using a block and it&#8217;s similar, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;I&#8217;m just using an image. Why is it different if I&#8217;m using the cover block or the image or the gallery block?&#8221; We should have a lot of congruence there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Totally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> And so it&#8217;s neat to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. Love it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> And then the HTML block forces the HTML preview when you&#8217;re in view mode, which I actually need to look at this and make sure I&#8217;m going to get this right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The view and design view, yeah, the edit view, that changes. I think there&#8217;s a writing, write mode coming that I have to dive into because the change was edit and view and now it&#8217;s write and design. And I need to figure out what the differences are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Oh yeah, if you ever offline, want to talk about that, I can do a deep dive about write mode. I&#8217;ve been up in there opening a lot of issues around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Hallway hangout about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Yes, I think that&#8217;d be really smart mode for any folks who have blocks bundled in their plugins, something to pay attention to. And there&#8217;s a great tutorial that I think Nick Diego just did around adopting your blocks to content only that you can find the developer blog. I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s live. I saw a draft and now I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m pretty sure I saw it live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s live. It&#8217;s live on the developer blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Okay. Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh. And I&#8217;ll share the link then in the show notes. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The next one is that we have a&#8230; Oh, your favorite feature. The zoom out note now has a keyboard shortcut to open up the editor of being available in the editor. You can zoom out per keyboard and you don&#8217;t have to look for that little icon there. And there&#8217;s an iterated zoom out shuffle into a more visual control. What does that entail?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> It&#8217;s cool. I can talk about that a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Before whenever you were zoomed out and looking at the patterns, there was this shuffle option. And while it was nice to just quickly switch through it, it shuffles through patterns of the same category. The issue is you&#8217;re not seeing visually what&#8217;s coming next and you can&#8217;t get at a glance, &#8220;I want to switch to this.&#8221; And so it changes it from this shuffle option to this change design option. You&#8217;re also a bit clearer on what it&#8217;s doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it gives you this nice little preview of, okay, change design, and then look at a list of the patterns related to this. And then you can visually select what you want to change it to rather than just a full blown shuffle, like what&#8217;s going to happen when I click this? It allows a bit more control and predictability to the experience. I was really excited to see this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have noticed I need to test this more as part of the fun of things when I was working on a site yesterday, that there&#8217;s a little bit of lag. Definitely keep&#8230; This is one of those areas that when we talk about zoom out is a great initial feature. I&#8217;m really excited to keep iterating to make it more useful. No, feedback is very much welcome there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The data views is the way how you in the site editor, you can navigate all through all the templates and all the pages and patterns. And it&#8217;s also the predecessor for the new admin design. But that has now in the templates, it hides the media field in the list view, which makes it a little bit more dense and more streamlined. Yeah. The next one is, I really love that, the style book now has a color tab where you can see all the color variations. This additional stuff, we&#8217;re going to talk about it in 19.7. But the style book is coming really to its better use now that we have all the different features like the style variations, block variations and that. Do you want to do the next one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Yeah. Real time collaboration, this is relating to inline commenting specifically. There was a lot of work being done around inline commenting that I think we&#8217;ll get into later. But basically comments were disabled for published posts for now. You can imagine this is basically to narrow the scope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we&#8217;re trying to get this feature in place to have it be ready for future release and maybe a bit beta form, there&#8217;s some just hard decisions that be made to narrow the scope so we&#8217;re not just completely exploding the scope and then something doesn&#8217;t work super well. The decision was made for post after they&#8217;ve been published to not have the ability to add comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we actually got great feedback from some folks in the enterprise space who there&#8217;s a channel for real time collaboration. I posted it about online commenting. And some of the enterprise folks are hanging out there and it was great. One of them actually chimed in on the main iteration issue for what&#8217;s coming next with online commenting and mentioned, &#8220;Hey, that thing you just disabled, we actually want that.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s part of the beauty of keeping folks up to date and having that tight feedback loop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second that was disabled, someone was like, &#8220;Can you revert that? I actually want that.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yes, yes, yes. Eventually we will revert. This is just for now narrowing scope.&#8221; That&#8217;s what you can get from that release. But that&#8217;s part of the beauty. I wanted to mention the feedback there because I think it&#8217;s really cool that folks are paying such close attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Behind the scenes stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I think I was one of the people who said, &#8220;I want this back.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Yes. Yeah, yeah, you comment on it too. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. But the inline commenting when you get&#8230; It&#8217;s an experiment still in Gutenberg, so you need to enable it so you can see it. But then it&#8217;s really good to have the&#8230; Because you can comment on each block and you can have replies. And it&#8217;s a great way to collaborate on things and have one editor there and have everybody else comment on a picture or on a block or on a quote or on a design. If you use the design tools and to just have it right there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you open up a post, you see the comments there, you can open it up, you can even pin it to your sidebar. It&#8217;s a great feature to test out and comment on. And when you have a few minutes in the afternoon or something like that, I really enjoyed it. And to see what&#8217;s coming next in the experiments, there are a lot of experiments in Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Yeah. I know we need to groom that list. I&#8217;m trying to wait for the right time to do a make test post asking for feedback. If you want to wait for more curated specific, &#8220;I can look at this post and follow these instructions and click on this link and I&#8217;ll open a WordPress Playground,&#8221; you can wait for that too. Because that is something&#8230; I just am trying to wait for us to fix some of the obvious stuff before asking people for their time. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;m always mindful of is the right time to bring folks in where it&#8217;s the most impactful for bringing feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I have to tell you, I love your test instructions. Every time something comes out, it&#8217;s such a great way to explore a new feature guided. But then all of a sudden, now that you know how it works, you can create an opinion and I always have an opinion. I travel with it, but then you also can pinpoint it to a certain instruction as well. It&#8217;s a guided testing instruction. And also exploring new features. You do fantastic work with that and I&#8217;m looking forward to some of the new ones that come out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Thank you. Yeah, that&#8217;s helpful to hear. Because I want it to be that. I want it to be both exploration and feedback. We need to be veering people into what&#8217;s coming next so they can have that opinion that you just described. Yeah, that&#8217;s really cool to hear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. The next one was on a backport that actually made it into 6.7. It was an improvement to get the post format in the query loop. And that is something that if your theme supports post formats, there is a way to do archive pages and all that. It&#8217;s not 100% seamless. There is some thinking through it from the developer part when you build a theme, but having that is definitely helpful so you don&#8217;t have to write the query yourself. There is a&#8230; I am a little bit&#8230; I don&#8217;t remember.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New APIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> I know this preview, I was like, &#8220;I can talk about this a little bit.&#8221; But yeah, basically, there&#8217;s, yeah, a new API is preview mode flag. And this is something that it looks like it&#8217;s been three years looking at the PR since this flag was there to basically allow, to indicate if a block is rendered as part of a blocks list, a block preview, a pattern preview, et cetera. And it&#8217;s a way, at this point we need to make it stable. And this came in again from feedback. What I really like to call out whenever this is influenced by feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this came up with in Jetpack where Riad was helping someone on the Jetpack team when they were asking questions. And he was like, &#8220;We should probably stabilize this. It&#8217;s been three years now. This isn&#8217;t actually unstable, but if we can render a placeholder for this, let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; And so this is really helpful and it&#8217;s just another signal. We do want to be careful about what we list is stabilized. And so this is one of those examples where it&#8217;s good to have just another tool in the toolbox to stabilize it for plugin authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely, because a lot of plugin authors are a little hesitant to use marked unstable or marked experimental flags features. And so adoption is really slow, although the things have been used in core or with other plugins quite a bit already and are stable, but they haven&#8217;t been made stable. And I know for the next release of 6.8, there&#8217;s a huge push on that for some of the design tools like the fonts and border controls and all that to make that what&#8217;s experimental to be stable and move that forward. It&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bug Fixes<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we are through the enhancement on 19.6, but there are a few bug fixes I wanted to point out. The first one is the self-nesting and circular nesting block fix. Up until that fix, it was really possible to have a block that has inner blocks to make it an inner block of itself. It&#8217;s like an Inception, if you ever saw that movie. It really confused the block and what to do with it. And you could also nest blocks that are the same nesting in multiple times. It&#8217;s like the infinite mirror when you go in zoom and you share a screen and everybody can&#8230; You see yourself multiple times, but that is definitely fixed. Or well, if it&#8217;s not, please let us know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the other part that I wanted to shout out is that there is the link shortcut only to be triggered when there is a text selection. And that has to do with the two features that are triggered by the same shortcut. And depending on which context you are, it gives you the right tool. Control K opens up the command palette where you can then just look for a new open site editor or create a new page. You can do this in the command palette, but it also lets you add a link to the canvas if you&#8217;re in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you are having a text selected, you could trigger that, creating a link with control K, but you wouldn&#8217;t be able to trigger the command palette. And if nothing is selected, that&#8217;s what you probably wanted. There were a few people, there&#8217;s a whole discussion about it in that PR about maybe changing the shortcut, but it&#8217;s the internet and the software developers have used the same shortcut for multiple things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s, yeah, exercise. People know about it, and here it comes together quite interestingly enough. But, well, I don&#8217;t know about you, but if I have a text selected, I don&#8217;t use Control K. And I just do copy-paste and have the link underneath my text selection. It doesn&#8217;t bother me, but it would&#8217;ve bothered me if Control K gives me the control panel, it doesn&#8217;t give me the command palette and rather opens the link feature there. I think it was a good decision. Riad made the pragmatic decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> I think it was a really good call because this is definitely, I have found it to be incredibly frustrating with the command pilot. And I think it has impacted the experience of using that and the likelihood of people using it in a way that it&#8217;s just not predictable. I think this will&#8230; I really hope it&#8217;s a meaningful improvement and it seems like it is based on&#8230; I actually helped test this at one point and just forgot to leave feedback. But yeah, I&#8217;m excited to see this in place and hope it helps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, it definitely does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> It&#8217;s a great call out. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I wanted to let everybody know that command palette, control K is a shortcut to get to you fast. And I think that&#8217;s it. Yeah, that&#8217;s pretty much what I wanted to talk about in Gutenberg 19.6. And we go right into 19.7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Let&#8217;s do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 19.7</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Let&#8217;s do it. It&#8217;s 148 PR. Is not as much as 19.6, but that was with 46 contributors and six of them were first timers. The release had 26 enhancements and 49 bug fixes. Bug fixes are a big, big piece of every release. And of course, I have in the show notes both the release posts and we can go into the enhancement. Do you want to start us out?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Yeah, I would love to. Now in the preview dropdown, the device preview dropdown, there is an option to show template. And before this was available in the setting sidebar, but it wasn&#8217;t super discoverable. And so this is just adding it there as well. Whenever you want to actually see a template preview, this option is now there whenever you&#8217;re trying to review your content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think this is one of those things that again, I am very curious to see how the feedback lands and how folks feel about it. If it ends up making sense to folks. We&#8217;ve added various things into that device preview dropdown. Including zoom out originally was thought of as being in the device preview and that was eventually moved. And I think this makes more sense conceptually. I was against zoom out being there, but I think having a template preview is a neat way to have a what you see is what you get. You may not need to go see the post in a new tab if you can just toggle this on and off to show or hide template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t know, for me personally, whenever I&#8217;m writing or creating stuff, I often start with having the template gone. I don&#8217;t want to see it. It&#8217;s a distraction. And then whenever I&#8217;m ready to see, &#8220;Okay, how does this actually look in context?&#8221; You can toggle that on for show template. And I think it&#8217;s a great small enhancement that can help with usability and curious to see how people like it and use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Absolutely. Yeah, and I&#8217;m really curious what people are going to do with the&#8230; Because the preview dropdown has been opened. There&#8217;s an API now for plugin developers to put it in. And I saw people put in view this in your newsletter because they use the block editor for the newsletter. And I also have seen it in I think blog visibility, what&#8217;s it on the front end when you have&#8230; The plugin block visibility by Nick Diego has an option to see it what is it that I showed. Where you can show and hide things. And he was able to manage the canvas to actually show and hide things quite easily. Yeah. It was really interesting what plugin developers are going to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy: </em>Yeah, I agree. I think it&#8217;s the preview options API, I just was looking it up to make sure I had the name and was available in 6.7. I think it&#8217;s a pretty cool&#8230; The accessibility there feels pretty powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Absolutely. Yeah. And this is, the next thing is more like a PSA so to speak, that the view external link that is in the toolbar on top is actually now at the end of the editor header controls. It got moved, so don&#8217;t be confused. It&#8217;s now on its final place for now until we move it again. But yeah, I think the zoom out button or link made us think a little bit more about what is the order of those things. And it would really help to get some feedback on it. What do you think about it? Yeah, just don&#8217;t miss it. It&#8217;s there. You just need to look a little left on it. And the next one is, can you talk about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Oh, yeah, I would love to. There&#8217;s situations where there&#8217;s a post, you&#8217;re writing a post, you have a number of images in the post. And let&#8217;s say you want a quicker way to just set a featured image. There&#8217;s now an option where if no featured image is set, you can set any image to be the featured image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy: </em>Yeah, it&#8217;s really cool and it comes from this desire to make it easier for folks whenever they&#8217;re in the flow of writing things. And as we know, images are really powerful. If you switch themes and you don&#8217;t have a bunch of featured images set, it can be a pain. There&#8217;s a lot of broader thinking around this. This is just an initial iteration to make it really easy to make sure to just set an image as a featured image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I definitely plan on using this. Because I always am reusing&#8230; I&#8217;ll post a blog post, I have a gallery of images, I love taking photos. And then I have to go again and select the featured image and go through the media library and all sorts of stuff. And now instead I can just be like that one, I want that one as a featured image. Through that, set as featured image. And so it just uses the same set as featured image property as it&#8217;s used elsewhere in the system. It&#8217;s also really cool use case with that. I&#8217;m excited to see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>I have two questions about it. One is if I set it as a featured image, then I can take it out of the post because it&#8217;s a different storage? Yes. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> I think so. Yeah. I think it&#8217;s basically it&#8217;s an attribute that&#8217;s set. And so, if it doesn&#8217;t have a featured image, it&#8217;ll be set as a featured image of the post. And you can also, if you override that and set the featured image, I&#8217;m pretty sure then that will be the priority is whatever is set as a featured image in that flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Most of the time or sometimes the theme supports featured image in a blog post. Then if you take an image that&#8217;s in the canvas as a featured image and it still stays in the post, then all of a sudden you have a double in there. It depends on how the theme works or how you set up your templates for the single post. If that&#8217;s a trained method now for you, yeah, you probably want to switch off the display of the featured image on the single post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy: </em>Yeah. Because that is such a&#8230; I right now have a theme that has&#8230; It does duplicate and I just decide to accept it. And I often, because block themes are so powerful, I&#8217;ll just go on a site editor and make sure that it looks good or looks separate and doesn&#8217;t feel too, I don&#8217;t know, annoying, where it&#8217;s like the images are just right after each other. And that&#8217;s one of the cool things with block themes is you can always just edit it or straight up remove it from your template if you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s fascinating what you can do, what you couldn&#8217;t do before. Yeah, yeah. The next two are other ones of getting more support for blocks. That&#8217;s the post content. Block now has border support and spacing support. And the details block also got anchor support. You could have the header of the details block be an anchor so you can link to it, which is very powerful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Oh, this is a big one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah. Can I talk about it? I&#8217;m obsessed with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, talk about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Okay. I&#8217;m going to tell the story of the background of this. When the site editor first was launched and people would drop into the editor, the site editor and start building, they would stumble on this style section. And a lot of folks thought that they were just styling their template. Whatever they were looking at, it was like, &#8220;Oh, cool, I&#8217;m styling just what I&#8217;m seeing.&#8221; And it&#8217;s actually styling everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The style section when you&#8217;re in the editor is styling everything, whether you can see it or not. And so this was almost like an information architecture problem, a UX problem. And to help start to alleviate this and to communicate the global nature, the same styles experience you get when you&#8217;re in the editor is being moved to the top level in that dark sidebar. Designers call that the frame. The frame of the experience or that dark sidebar before you get into the canvas and the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s being moved to the top level. Whenever you first enter the site editor, you&#8217;ll see those same sections that you&#8217;re used to seeing. And when you hit styles, it&#8217;ll actually bring you in using data views. This great view of all your styles experience that you would expect whenever you&#8217;re actually in the editing experience. And the hope is that this will allow folks to understand that it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re editing everything. And in line with the other changes were done to allow you to toggle between the style book and previewing your site. And so, I think it&#8217;s a really exciting way to see when you first are landing there. I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s in 19.7. There&#8217;s basically a new landing section that&#8217;s added to the style book. I&#8217;m 99% sure I&#8217;ve tested this a ton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s also in line with this, there&#8217;s some upgrades to the style book. The style book is a bit better laid out. And then there&#8217;s also this landing section that basically pulls the most important information from your theme related to styles so that when you get there you get this sense of like, &#8220;Okay, this is the styling of my site, these are the colors, this is the typography.&#8221; And it just is meant to be a clear, easier to understand experience that you&#8217;re impacting the entire site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that said, you will still have access to styles when you&#8217;re in the editor, so it duplicates it. And I am really curious to get feedback from folks because I think this is going to be confusing. I think folks are going to see the same thing and think, &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference? Is this the same? I&#8217;m not really sure. Is this for the entire site and this is for the template.&#8221; And so that&#8217;s one of the things that&#8217;s part of the beauty of iterating in Gutenberg before a major release is to get that feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And part of the reason to keep it in the editor is for block themers who will want to be making changes while they&#8217;re editing templates and not just necessarily at the high level. There were a couple of different use cases to have to accommodate there. And part of the issue that we can figure out is what does the user experience look like between the two? How do we connect the two experiences?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe when you open styles in the editor, it automatically brings you to that view. I&#8217;m not really sure, but there&#8217;s ways that design thinking can be applied to this. I&#8217;m really excited about this. This helps to solve, it starts to solve a long-standing issue around communicating styles as global styles, styles as impacting your entire site. And it just brings that sidebar at the top level to be a bit more useful. And so I&#8217;m obviously way too excited about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>No, no, no, no. I&#8217;m really glad that you explained it. Also, the whole genesis of it because I remember those feedback from the FSC program here that people are&#8230; And I always attributed to that there&#8217;s another level of abstraction and another level of design coming with the templates where users never had access to it so they didn&#8217;t have to learn that new concept. That stumbles them, but there is a way to actually alleviate that from the user experience. That&#8217;s brilliant. And I&#8217;m really happy that it also ties the style book of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I saw was if you go through the styles in the middle section and you change the color palette in the style book, then in the right hand side, you can then see how that affects every single block or every single&#8230; Yeah. You can actually really make decisions about if you wanted that or do you need to do some additional adjustments there. The style book gives you a whole good overview. And it was always a little bit off site if you&#8230; It was hard to discover and now it&#8217;s right there for you to see. Yeah, so I&#8217;m really happy about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> I&#8217;ll share a little sneak peek. I was talking with some of the developers yesterday about this. But some of the work also to bring this to the top level, have it be like that is to then expose it for classic themes. Can you imagine a style book for classic themes and this landing section for classic themes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit, and this again goes back to phase two and gradual adoption and how important it is that we have these on ramps and ways of bringing some of these new features to everyone who&#8217;s using WordPress. And so that&#8217;s a PR in progress expected on a future Gutenberg Times episode. And all block themers out there and all themers in general out there, this is a great area to give feedback and to see how it works with your theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah, the style book. When I was implementing some Gutenberg sites in the early days, 2018, I would create a post with all the blocks in there so we could, together with a client, look at how everything&#8217;s going to look from the theme point of view and where adjustments need to be made. But that was a major effort to put all the blocks in there. The style book is such a great tool. And bringing that to the classic theme is definitely a great way to foster adoption. Also to make the life of a classic theme developer a little bit easier doing that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Yeah. We got a lot of good feedback from folks being like, &#8220;I want this. Why can&#8217;t I use this yet? How can I use this?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s the best thing that comes with Gutenberg and, &#8220;I need it.&#8221; I can totally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> And I love that feedback loop. And then one of the things, the next thing to think about is what does that look like to expose it in the appearance menu? We have patterns, do we have a style? And then what about the font library? Where&#8217;s the order of things? These are things that are on my mind. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, do we have them all separate? When do we bring them together? What does that experience look like for exposing these things?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, the holistic approach to design is so important. Yeah. But that&#8217;s the whole story about Gutenberg. You need to first do the small things so you can do it in context with the big things. And it&#8217;s really a little slow to go from the small things to the big things when you do something new. The iteration and the feedback loop is really, really important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Here&#8217;s your landing section for the style book is the next one. Next item on the style book tab. Then the next one is something that surprised me a bit, that we have now an exposed filter in the drop down for the individual image on select or upload media that says, &#8220;Okay, filter the medium about uploaded in this post or unattached pictures or to show me just my pictures.&#8221; Yeah. It&#8217;s filtering down to something that we were never exposed to before and it&#8217;s really an enhancement of the media library for this Gutenberg section. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Yeah. And I&#8217;ll note that this actually really nicely ties into phase three. I know it doesn&#8217;t seem like it at first, but one of the things that whenever I talk to enterprise folks, imagine you are writing 50 articles a day. And you have photographers, you have media teams, you have all this sort of stuff. And you&#8217;re trying to add content, you&#8217;re trying to add media to a post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest things is, is this file in the doc already and is it attached to this post in any way? They need quick ways to identify very fast, is this already in here? If not, can I add it in? And because it helps prevent people from uploading the same image five times. This is something that starts down that path of thinking about media library improvements, the workflow related to it. And whenever you&#8217;re creating content in mass with lots of different people, how can you make it clearer and easier to quickly filter?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m so glad you called this out. I actually totally missed this. It seems like a smaller thing, but it actually directly ties into feedback that&#8217;s come into the project. I think it&#8217;s a cool quality of life improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I can see that. Then especially the net has become so much more visible, visual that you need the pictures or the videos or the audio a little bit more sorted so that&#8217;s wonderful. Yeah, so I think we&#8217;re through the enhancements and I haven&#8217;t seen…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Oh, I can point out one thing that I think could be good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes, please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> We were talking about this write mode, and this relates to this. This is like a bug fix. Write mode is exposed currently. And the plugin, it&#8217;s actually as of&#8230; I just checked the issue today that I opened. Between user testing and feedback, it&#8217;s pretty clear that it needs to be behind an experiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s actually going to be moved behind an experiment, but that will happen in 19.8. I&#8217;m pretty sure not 19.7. But in the meantime, to help reduce some of the confusion that we saw some folks running into, it basically makes it so that the tool selector between write and design is not exposed in the post editor. You&#8217;re only in design mode. And design mode, it shows all the tools. You can see everything, which is what you&#8217;re used to. Write mode offers that content only experience. It really just focuses on the content. It really&#8230; There&#8217;s a lot to figure out there, but I think of it as it contains the experience just to the purity of writing. It just is focused on the words. You can&#8217;t add a block, you can&#8217;t remove a block. It&#8217;s a very simplified editing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, this basically has it so it&#8217;s only available in this write mode whenever you&#8217;re in the site editor. Which makes sense where you get that overwhelm and that&#8217;s where someone might just want to focus on the content of their template. But in the post editor, it doesn&#8217;t make as much sense. If you&#8217;re writing content, you don&#8217;t necessarily need to have these two different options. For 19.7, this is with landing. And then in the future, this will be put behind an experiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Okay. Yeah, I think we should do a separate podcast episode about all the 15 experiments in Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Yes, that would actually be a really cool episode. I would love that. I would be game for that. For sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> We definitely would need to do this on video because we&#8217;re going to demo things and all that. Yeah. Yeah. I will keep it in the back of my mind for next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And we can do that. Yeah. Because we have until April until the new version comes out so there&#8217;s a lot of experiments that come up. yeah. The listeners, this was 16. 16. Yeah. 6.7 or 19.7. It&#8217;s 16.7. Yeah. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Yes. When you said it, it made perfect sense to me. I&#8217;m not going to lie. I was like, &#8220;Yep, that&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s in Active Development or Discussed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: This was Gutenberg 19.7. And so we are at the section of what&#8217;s in active development or discussed. And we mentioned it before, there is these inline commenting that actually was almost entirely done by a group of contributors from a sponsored company called Multidots. And Pooja Bhimani, I hope I pronounced that right, is the lead on that. And they released the first and experimental version of inline commenting for the block editor. I think you were involved in that a little bit more heavily. Do you want to talk about this a bit more?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy: </em>Yeah, I would love to talk about it. I think it&#8217;s a great example of a wonderful contribution story for a really big feature. And the team over at Multidots reached out and they built a number of collaboration tools within their plugin and naturally wanted to help Core. And so this was where they decided to jump in. And right now they have shipped an initial version of 19.5, I think is what it got into, for inline comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what it does is block level inline comments. You can comment on an entire block and you cannot comment on a sentence within that block. It&#8217;s an initial prototype to get some of the kinks out. And Ella, one of them, EllaTrips I think is her GitHub username.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, long, long, long time WordPress contributor and Core contributor has been really helping there as well as Riad and Joen and design. There&#8217;s just been a lot of beautiful coming together to move this feature forward. And it&#8217;s basically in a state where they&#8217;re both starting to chip away at some of the minor bugs, like, &#8220;Okay, these are obvious things to fix.&#8221; And then they&#8217;re going to work on implementing a new design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s some really cool designs on there, both for the short term and thinking really long term. I actually have a post I&#8217;m hoping to share today, sharing an update about all these different phase three areas. And this is just one of those big areas to keep in mind and to follow. There&#8217;s a lot of momentum and there&#8217;s a lot of work being done there. And Multidots has done a great job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a huge thing to jump into as a first contribution. And so huge kudos to them. This is not an easy task. I think they&#8217;ve been working on this since April of this last year. It&#8217;s been a huge effort to come together. And it&#8217;s been really fun to work with them and to watch them develop directly in the Gutenberg plugin and land something and iterate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s part of the cool thing with the Gutenberg plugin and with the&#8230; It&#8217;s an experiment right now, so you have to turn it on under Gutenberg experiments. But expect to see more to come there and test, a call for testing from yours truly eventually. I&#8217;m hoping next week. That&#8217;s one of my top priorities for next week and this week is to get that announced update post out about the different areas of phase three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, I&#8217;m really excited about it. I think it&#8217;s a cool thing if you&#8217;re a small editorial team to try it out. If you&#8217;re a plugin author, think about how you might want to extend it. All that workflow collaboration head space, this is one of the first meteor things, or probably the second meteor thing that&#8217;s land other than data use, which is a huge thing. I just completely&#8230; Data views is the first, this is the second. And so, I&#8217;m really excited to see some of these phase three features that are really tangible begin to get out into the open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Well, I&#8217;m glad you bring this all to us. And I think we are all&#8230; Yeah, test it all out. Did you say you want to post it today or tomorrow?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> The update for phase three will be today. I want it out today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I will bring it into the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy: </em>Perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; because we are not going to publish that until Sunday. Today is Thursday, so it&#8217;s really good. I&#8217;m going to share it in the show notes. I think that&#8217;s an update on the real collaboration on commenting and interviews. I&#8217;m very much looking forward to reading that as a whole.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. This is, we are at the end of the show today, although with two plugins and Anne here, we have a great show. And next show would be in two weeks with Sarah Norris and it will be the last of 2024. And then I&#8217;ll go on vacation. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy:</em> Good. Good. Love to hear it. You got to rest. Congrats on over 100. I cannot believe you have over a hundred episodes of this. That&#8217;s really incredible. I keep thinking about that at the beginning of the show. I think that&#8217;s so cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, thank you. Yeah. I couldn&#8217;t have done it without you and all the other guests that are here that bring their brilliance to here. Because I only see one side of things and having other aspects of it makes it so much richer. Dear listeners, as always, the show notes will be published on <a href=\"http://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast\">gutenbergtimes.com/podcast</a>.

Héctor mentioned, “Although the 6.8 dates aren’t final yet, they are close to final enough to let contributors know their availability around that time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community can share their feedback on the release schedule either in the comments below the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/11/19/proposal-major-releases-for-2025/\">post </a>or via a Slack DM by November 29, 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress 6.8 Call for Volunteers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Héctor Prieto has shared the tentative timeline for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/11/21/wordpress-6-8-call-for-volunteers/\">WordPress 6.8</a>, which will include up to Gutenberg 20.4 with a maximum of 11 releases.

Moving forward, all updates for the plugin will be served directly from PeepSo’s servers. Explaining the decision, Jaworski expressed dissatisfaction with the repository, stating, “We have never been very happy with the WordPress repository, as we found their rules to be convoluted, poorly defined and too open for interpretation – that includes both the Plugin Guidelines and the way the support and review forums are moderated by them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Reasons Behind the Decision</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>He shared that several factors contributed to this move like learning recently that WordPress.org is not owned by the WordPress Foundation, as many assume, but is instead a private website managed by Matt Mullenweg. This, combined with unsettling actions by WordPress.org, such as banning developers, disabling plugin updates for client sites, and even taking over an entire plugin, led to a loss of trust. He noted, <em>“</em>We have thus lost our trust in the WordPress.org platform, the WordPress Foundation itself, and most importantly the man who seems to wield the ultimate power in the entire ecosystem.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PeepSo was also suspended without a warning for issues that were already fixed. He explained,“There were a few cases where security researchers pentested our demo site, and found some minor issues. WP.org jumped on these and suspended our plugin, even though the issues were in our paid addons, or even third party software &#8211; NOT in the plugin hosted on WP.org. They have since apologized, but the issue of having our plugin suspended without warning stands &#8211; it affects our release cycle and our customers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.peepso.com/community/?status/156601-156601-1727260854\"><img width=\"1756\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-180266\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>“All that combined with the WPEngine drama led us to the decision to finally pull out of WordPress.org &#8211; WP.org hijacking a plugin from under the original devs was the final straw. That was the day we decided too pull the trigger and focused on removing the WP.org dependency from our business.”, he continued.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Moving Forward</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Existing users of PeepSo will need to manually update the base plugin to version 7.0.0.0, after which all updates will be delivered directly from PeepSo’s servers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaworski also hinted at potential changes to improve code organization and performance. “The Plugin Guidelines prevented us from putting premium code in the base plugin (paywalled) so we were forced to encapsulate paid features into separate plugins. There is an idea bouncing around of merging some premium code into the base plugin, and only enabling it based on the license type (free vs paid). This should lead to better code organization and performance improvements, but it&#8217;s just a general idea, likely not to be touched any time soon.”, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the ACF controversy, several plugin authors <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/developers-remove-plugins-from-wordpress-org-repository-after-acf-controversy\">removed their plugins</a> from the WordPress.org repository. Luc Princen, an eCommerce developer at Wooping,&nbsp; also <a href=\"https://x.com/LucP/status/1858476808481456368\">shared</a> on X that they weren&#8217;t going to put WPWooping&#8217;s new Shop Health plugin on the Repository and also published a <a href=\"https://wooping.io/blog/2024/11/why-were-not-releasing-on-wp-org-yet/\">blog post </a>detailing the reasons.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:33:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"Do The Woo Community: AI, DevOps, and Accessibility in WooCommerce with Anick Akbar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=87009\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://dothewoo.io/ai-devops-and-accessibility-in-woocommerce-with-anick-akbar/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:218:\"In this episode of Do the Woo, Anick from Pixable chats about his agency\'s journey with WordPress and WooCommerce, innovative client solutions, AI trends, compliance challenges, accessibility, and community engagement.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:40:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.7.1 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=18096\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/11/wordpress-6-7-1-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8607:\"<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress 6.7.1 is now available!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This minor release features 16 bug fixes <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?resolution=fixed&milestone=6.7.1&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=owner&col=type&col=status&col=priority&order=priority\">throughout Core</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/7851\">the Block Editor</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.7.1 is a fast-follow release with a strict focus on bugs introduced in WordPress 6.7.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast, which is dedicated to all things, WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, the shift to block by systems in all parts of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice. Or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcasts players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Fränk Klein. Fränk is a principal engineer at Human Made and brings a wealth of experience from his extensive history with WordPress, having started with the platform in 2011. He previously worked at Automattic, and now directs his expertise towards WP Development Courses, where he teaches block theme and custom block development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fränk talks about the modernization of PHP within WordPress, a topic that often gets overshadowed by the hype around Javascript. We get into Human Made&#8217;s work and enterprise focused WordPress agency renowned for serving high profile clients, such as the Harvard Gazette and TechCrunch. Fränk explains the intricate custom backend development needed to meet the complex requirements of enterprise clients, like sophisticated editorial workflows for clients like banks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fränk provides a comprehensive breakdown of the Gutenberg projects four phases, content editing, site customization, collaborative editing, and multi-lingual capabilities. We explore how FSE is transforming WordPress by integrating new editing tools, and modernizing the admin interface. Moving the platform from its classic roots to a more dynamic block-based editing environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fränk shares his unique perspectives on the challenges and rewards of engineering and teaching within the WordPress ecosystem. He stresses the importance of understanding client needs and the necessity for developers to engage in continuous learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also talk about using traditional WordPress solutions and third party page builders, like Bricks, Beaver Builder and Elementor. Fränk argues for the streamlined, block-based systems, offered by WordPress core, citing both financial and technical benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our conversation continues into the broader implications of WordPress&#8217;s ongoing evolution, the significant admin interface redesigns, and its impact on users and agencies. Fränk discusses, the challenges users face with these changes, and the importance of improving communications within the WordPress community to facilitate smoother transitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, Fränk talks about his experiences with course creation and content maintenance, particularly given the fast paced changes in WordPress features. He emphasizes the need for a solid grasp of foundational web development concepts to fully leverage the platforms evolving tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re keen on understanding how full site editing and other WordPress innovations can enhance your projects, and wish to gain insights into the evolving WordPress landscape, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes, many added by Fränk, by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Fränk Klein.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Fränk Klein. How are you doing Fränk?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:10] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> I&#8217;m doing great. Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Really nice to have you on the podcast today. We&#8217;re going to talk a lot about full site editing. I&#8217;m not entirely sure where the conversation is going to go. But before we do that, Fränk, just over to you really for a brief moment on your bio. Just tell us about your history with WordPress, perhaps where you work, maybe some interesting projects that you&#8217;ve worked on. Anything you like really, but just tell us a little bit about you and WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:35] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Yeah, so I started in WordPress in 2011, software engineer. I worked at a small agency in Luxembourg, and then from then I went to Automattic, wordpress.com, then VIP. And now I&#8217;m at Human Made, where I&#8217;m now principal engineer, which is great. I get to work on a lot of interesting projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And kind of out of that activity comes my WP Development Courses business. So where I do sell courses to WordPress developers. So obviously block theme development is one of the focuses of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing is, because I am self-taught, it kind of simplifies with the people that don&#8217;t have any formal background in programming, and I try to help this out as much as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> For your courses, do you focus entirely on blocks, and full site editing, and the new, in air quotes, way of doing WordPress? Is that your thing, Gutenberg a hundred percent?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:22] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> It used to be that, but now, so there is one on block theme development, there&#8217;s one on custom block development. But now I&#8217;m also going back to a course that I previously, which is about WordPress unit testing, so PHP unit testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the title I like to use right now is more modern PHP, so what&#8217;s happening in the PHP world. Because I think that we have been moving a lot, we have been talking a lot about JavaScript and everything like that, but that has kind of slowed down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the PHP has picked up quite a lot, because PHP is modernising quite rapidly in terms of how the language works. And PHP is still a big part of WordPress, even though it doesn&#8217;t get maybe the love that we need to give it to. But yeah, there&#8217;s lots of interesting things happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s certainly not getting the attention that it once did. In fact, almost to the point where it never gets mentioned really. But like you said, quite a lot of exciting developments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, just very, very briefly, the Human Made side of things, if you haven&#8217;t come across Human Made, Human Made are a, I&#8217;m going to call it enterprise agency. Do you just want to give us some insight into the kind of work that you and the team do over there? What kind of projects you&#8217;re involved in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may or may not be able to elucidate on that, but just interested to know at that kind of level, what kind of projects you might be involved in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:29] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Yes, Human Made, we call it an enterprise WordPress agency. Now, enterprise can be a very wide word, what fits in there? But Human Made works with everything from publishing companies, to banks, to universities. One of the more recent projects that my colleagues in the US did was the Harvard Gazette, a really great project also block based.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we have worked in the past with TechCrunch, the million dollar website as Jamie called it. So that was the previous iteration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so generally, when it comes to enterprise, what distinguishes it from the rest of WordPress is maybe not, so the budget definitely is, because the budgets tend to be higher, but enterprises, they have very specific needs. So there&#8217;s a lot of custom development, and they have a lot of demand, especially for backend customisations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you build a website, there&#8217;s always going to be the front end, the design, everything like that. But that&#8217;s the same across every project. But when you go to the enterprise, depending on the type of business that you run, for example, a bank, what we have developed is a system where instead of just when you hit publish, the blog post goes live, or the content. There is a system where it goes to approval, and then they can say that the change isn&#8217;t approved. So all of those publishing customisations there&#8217;s a little part of it. It&#8217;s the workflow and also the interface. So that&#8217;s a big part of what we do is actually customising the editing experience in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Really interesting. You can go and check those websites out. Just by the way, anything that we mention in the podcast today, you can get the show notes over at wptavern.com/podcast. Go and search over there, and anything that we mention, if we don&#8217;t read out the URL, you&#8217;ll be able to find it, including links to Human Made, and Fränk&#8217;s courses as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But turning to the main focus of the podcast today, we&#8217;re going to try and get into the weeds of FSE, full site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you are fairly new to WordPress, you may be unfamiliar that there was ever any change. But if you&#8217;ve been in WordPress for anything longer than a couple of years, you&#8217;ll know that what has changed over the last several years has been pretty profound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s kind of all wrapped up inside the Gutenberg project, if you like, which has come in four phases. We&#8217;re currently on the third of those four phases, collaborative editing. I have to say, the collaborative editing piece seems to have stopped becoming the center of all attention at the moment. I haven&#8217;t seen a great deal of coverage of that, but hopefully that will pick up and we&#8217;ll get something akin to Google Docs, or something like that inside our WordPress installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the first of those phases, content editing, was followed by site customisation and then, like I said, we&#8217;re in collaborative editing at the moment. And then finally ending up with multilingual, so the ability to natively turn your site into a multilingual website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where does full site editing fit into all of this jigsaw puzzle, Fränk? And also what promise does it bring? How will it change a WordPress install from a couple of years ago to something in the more, air quotes, modern WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:25] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> That&#8217;s a big question, but it goes back to when we talk about full site editing. So what we now say is full site editing, essentially site editor. That is what we call the tool that is in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other part of it is the block theme. And those together then form what we now call full site editing. And that is the second phase actually of the Gutenberg roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the thing is, at this moment, if you go to WordPress install at this time, and you click on the admin, it looks like it has always looked, right? The admin hasn&#8217;t changed, but when you go to the post editor, you get the block editor. When you go to the appearance, so let&#8217;s go to the theme editor, what comes up is the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so right now we having these weird experiences where you click on the post edit and it becomes full screen, and the admin UI is gone, inside it is kind of the same. And so we need to understand those four phases, not as being four different things that are going to be delivered, but really it&#8217;s just pieces of one big admin redesign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, I think, what was in the beginning. And so Matt, Matt Mullenweg published a blog post, I think it was in 2017. I think we called it Gutenberg For a Reason, that was the title. And it really laid out everything that they want to change, all of the people that this concerns, which is everybody that uses WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And once that kind of groundwork was laid, they didn&#8217;t go into it much afterwards. So that is why, when we talk about full site editing, we have these two pieces. What it changes right now, and just the specific concerns that we have with it. But also the groundwork that is laid for the phase three, which is right now is called still collaboration, but I think it&#8217;s more content editing reimagined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because right now, if you&#8217;re on the site editor, sure, you have functionalities like, I can change my templates, I can change the header, the footer, or the patterns, all that is built in. But you also now have, for example, pages available in the site editor, and you can go into content editing mode, you can go into template editing mode. So already we are mixing everything together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that is the part where, when we go to phase two, the original name was customisation. So it wasn&#8217;t theme building, it wasn&#8217;t theme adaptation, it was really customisation because the idea was that, with a site editor, we&#8217;re going to reimagine the way that you interact with your WordPress website. And so the phases two and three are just going extend on that admin concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so WordPress under the hood, as part of this, is building out all of the pieces that are going to be put in place to complete admin redesign. Then actually, if you look at WooCommerce, which is of course one of the biggest, if not, I think the biggest plugin out there in WordPress, they&#8217;re are doing the same thing while they are modernising their admin experience. They&#8217;re both aligning to give that new interface feel to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s something which is not a lot talked about in the wider community, that for sure we have the theme building, we have that very practical aspects, but it&#8217;s also the bigger perspective in that we are going to need to get rid of that admin that we know right now, which has been by now as old as WordPress, close to being as old as WordPress. So it&#8217;s a complete redoing of the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Coming from an agency which is dealing with big ticket items, you know, websites that presumably have some sort of fairly large user base, and certainly I would imagine fairly deep pockets for their development, bespoke development at that. But also having a set of courses which are trying to teach aspects of all this, how do you think the whole phases approach has been handled, but particularly the redesign?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And rather than calling it full site editing, let&#8217;s call it what I think you called it, something along the lines of the admin redesign, or something like that. How do you think that&#8217;s gone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what my question really is asking is, if you could rewind the clock, let&#8217;s say four years, to a period in which the admin had not been redesigned in any way, shape, or form, you could create content with the block editor inside posts, and pages, and so on, but outside of that, everything was as it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you feel that it&#8217;s been managed, the transition slowly over time into this reimagined admin area, full site editing and what have you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My impression, because I&#8217;m in it all the time, and I see the tiny little changes, and I notice it happening, it doesn&#8217;t really jar with me all that much, but I have the intuition that people who are, I don&#8217;t know, casual users of WordPress, perhaps they&#8217;re just logging into achieve a thing on their Monday morning that they need to do on the website, and then they want to log out and never look at the website again for the rest of the week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel it must have been quite a difficult thing to keep track of. New things this week, which are removed next week, and then another thing replaces it, and then, oh, if I click here, oh look, now it looks nothing like it did five minutes ago and for the last 20 years. So how well do you think it&#8217;s been handled? How easy has it been for people to cope with? I know that&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:09] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Yeah, I think that we can always look back and say, I would&#8217;ve done this and that in the other, knowing in hindsight. That&#8217;s always the luxury that we have. But, it kind of depends on how you want to develop your product. And I think that WordPress, what we shouldn&#8217;t forget is that a lot of people now look at WordPress and say, well, a lot is changing and some things are unstable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But actually if we go back in time, it kind of always has been like that. It&#8217;s just that most people do not see the changes that were done because they are just dealing with the admin, they&#8217;re doing content editing stuff which was very stable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I remember when the customiser was introduced. I mean, it wasn&#8217;t like this was the smoothest launch ever. And so I still remember because then I was, I think I was already at Automattic, or maybe not. But the situation was that every theme had their custom admin pages with a bunch of fields, they had their own frameworks. Everybody was sad, everybody was happy. And so then WordPress comes and says, oh, we are now going to do customiser. Huge drama, nobody wants to change it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then years later everybody uses a customiser, and now the next thing comes along, it&#8217;s like, oh, now we&#8217;re going to use the site editor. Huge drama. So it&#8217;s just a repeating cycle. But where it is difficult is, yeah, just these changes being introduced. The patterns, for example, it started out with having reusable blocks. I think that was the first feature that there was. So saving a block into the database, you can add it to other pages. And then if you change one instance, everything updates, great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then comes a pattern, which is more a theme developer thing back then, because you could only do it in themes previously. So you have these two concepts, and then suddenly they say, well, this is kind of the same thing because what we want to do now is you should be able to change the patterns also in the editor. So why don&#8217;t we just merge the two because they are similar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those get merged in and then that&#8217;s, I think it was at 6.2, or 6.3. Then it&#8217;s me standing there, hey, in 6.2 we used reusable blocks, but now it&#8217;s called a pattern, now it works this way. So obviously there&#8217;ve been a lot of changes and I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to stop because they&#8217;re just trying things and getting feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But generally it&#8217;s also the case that if you look at your clients in the agency world, they&#8217;re using very few features actually of the whole thing. So what we see as developers, all of the changes, for them it doesn&#8217;t really matter to be honest, in most cases, doesn&#8217;t matter. If you tell them, hey, what used to be a reusable block now is a pattern, they&#8217;re going to say, okay, yeah, I get it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of hard how this thing has been rolled out. But definitely what I do criticise is that we all remember the famous learn JavaScript deeply speech, and it was good advice, but also bad advice. The advice was good because the direction was, everybody&#8217;s using JavaScript, so we as WordPress are also going to go more into JavaScript because they need it to build those interactive experiences. But learn JavaScript deeply is not a great path to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so if you talk to me and tell me I&#8217;m in this situation, I will need to learn this, I&#8217;m going to say, you do this, you that, you do the other, right? It&#8217;s a roadmap, and you can just follow it and it&#8217;ll work out fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in the beginning there wasn&#8217;t really a lot of direction, what you should learn, how you should learn it. And also all of the things that we have now, where we have a dedicated developer blog, where we have people like Jamie, there is Justin, there is Nick Diego, there&#8217;s Rich. So all these people that we know like, in quotes. There are two community outreach, developer outreach, things like that, wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think if you would have that right from the beginning, all these people, it would&#8217;ve been a lot smoother because you still need somebody to, it&#8217;s one thing to have a change log that says, WordPress is now adding this feature, but that is not of the what.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so then they also show the how, but you are not understanding the why. And so the why is the big piece where we need somebody that comes in and says, okay, we have this feature, it works this way. But you can use it in this fashion, in that fashion. And so that kind of basic layer of just the big why things are there, I think that is missing just in the free content that is out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;ve got a couple of things to add to that. So the first thing is I think the customiser bit that you said, was similar in magnitude, you know, and confusion. I guess the thing about the customiser is at least there was just one single purpose for being there. If you went into the customiser, it was basically to change the way things looked. Colors, or padding, or the number of posts in an archive, or whatever it may be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You were looking at the way the front end looked in the customiser, and you could understand that. I guess the difference here with the admin overhaul, again, there&#8217;s no perfect word for it, but that&#8217;ll do, is that it encapsulates so many things, and that it&#8217;s a completely rolling program. So, it&#8217;ll be this one week, and then a few weeks later it&#8217;ll be something slightly different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And like you said, the naming of things gets changed. And then you get things like synced patterns and all of that, that we just have to rename things over time. But in the end, it&#8217;ll settle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also think that there is definitely more boots on the ground. The appointment of Jamie Marsland, you&#8217;ve said Jamie&#8217;s name a couple of times, I&#8217;m assuming that you mean Jamie Marsland, being put out as a, not really the developer advocate, but when things have been developed, his task now is to corral people himself and other people in the community to put out content to show how that works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that was a real missing piece. And then you&#8217;ve obviously got learn.wordpress.org, developer.wordpress.org, and all of these different resources. And I think more work is going in right now than ever has before on the education piece afterwards. Whether or not people are seeing them, I don&#8217;t know. But it definitely seems like there is more effort going into explain how things are done, almost at the same time that they&#8217;re getting released, if you know what I mean. So content on YouTube within weeks of a new feature dropping, that&#8217;s new to me, and it&#8217;s really helpful when I see those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:53] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Right. I think the problem that WordPress has is that you have so many different profiles, and it&#8217;s hard to do content which fits everybody because there is the user aspect. So that is more on the WordPress Learn side. So that&#8217;s more end user, I would call it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie is also, I guess, in that space, and then you have the developer blog is very much more developer stuff. But one of the challenges is when we look at what I teach, so I do teach the features for sure, but it&#8217;s all down to a specific angle. And so the challenge that we have, I think in WordPress, and that we need to recognise is that when I learned WordPress, I didn&#8217;t just open WordPress and then started typing stuff. I knew that it used PHP. So I first learned PHP, I was actually quite decent in PHP before I got to the WordPress, which is lucky for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the thing is that, yes, there is a lot of content that is being released, but it&#8217;s all very piecemeal. And so the challenge is that you need to take a step back, that&#8217;s how I organise my learning materials, that we need to understand the big picture, the concepts that are there, and then once you understand those, then you&#8217;re going to be able to understand all of the rest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it&#8217;s the same thing when you go from, for example, so I knew PHP, that is the language that I definitely learned from books and everything like that. And then JavaScript, I knew somewhat, I mean, jQuery really, let&#8217;s be honest. But then when I had to learn it for real, my knowledge of PHP helped me a lot because I understood all of the concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, it&#8217;s not just code. I know what a variable is, what the function is, how it works, what scope is. All of these more foundational stuff that you learn when you have a computer sciences background, or something like that, formal education, you&#8217;ll learn it. But when you&#8217;re self-taught you&#8217;ll not necessarily learn that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that is something missing because, for example, Jamie has those speed builds, right? And I find them cool, they&#8217;re a cool demo. And we kind of had this little disagreement of where I said, the speed build is cool, but it&#8217;s that, it&#8217;s cool. You don&#8217;t really build websites for clients this way, where you go in and choose just will nilly change stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to really go into the design and say, okay, what are the font, the sizes, the colors, the spacings. So really create that design system, then you enter that. And once you have that foundation, where all of those design system values are created, then you start building out the designs. And then we&#8217;ll see that most of the stuff that you drop in, it already looks like it should look. It has the right font, it has the right size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s more, because when you write CSS it&#8217;s the same thing. You don&#8217;t just look at the red button and make a red button class. No, you have a certain color system, you have a certain foundational values for the HTML tag. So everything that way that you would build out your CSS in layers, that go from the least specific to the most specific, with full site editing is quite the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the challenge that we have as a developer community is to realise that with the tooling is changing, and we are now building things visually, but all of the, let&#8217;s say the tech part underneath it, it&#8217;s still the same. It&#8217;s HTML, it&#8217;s CSS, it&#8217;s PHP, right? So that&#8217;s what the front end runs on. And we just need to take those concepts and apply them in the site editor. And then the transition is going to be a lot easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But definitely some developers have a problem with, instead of just saying, I want to write code, I&#8217;ve decided that you&#8217;re not really writing a lot of code, and that is unfortunately or fortunately where the direction is going. That depends on how you&#8217;re looking at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think with the whole perspective that we need to have on this is that you may look at the site editor and say, it&#8217;s weird that it tries to do this page builder like approach with content editing built in. Because a lot of developers say, I want it to distinguish from each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s more that the people that now start building websites with any of the tools that are out there, that is the experience that they get, it&#8217;s a visual builder. And so in the same way as, my daughter is six years old, she doesn&#8217;t know what the landline phone is. She saw one at my grandparents and she says, what&#8217;s that? Well, that&#8217;s a phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yeah, for them, the children that grow up now, obviously everything is a smartphone, everything has a touch interface. They don&#8217;t know what we knew with actual buttons, and blackberries, and all that stuff. And so that&#8217;s the perspective that we need to take. There was a very interesting podcast with Josh Hall, who has a podcast, and Mark Szymanski I think, I hope I&#8217;m not butchering his name. I think the title was even, is WordPress for old people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yeah, I mean, I&#8217;m 40. I&#8217;m not really old, but I&#8217;m not spring chicken. And that&#8217;s a perspective that we need to have. We are in the middle of this transition and we know the old, and the new, and for us, while we&#8217;re in the middle of that transition, it&#8217;s going to be hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But every day there are new people coming onto the web, and WordPress needs to be the thing that they expect, needs to be a visual builder. And they don&#8217;t know about the customiser/ they for sure don&#8217;t know about settings, pages that we used in the past. For them it&#8217;s all, it&#8217;s as much history as a landline phone. And so that&#8217;s a perspective which we need to have when we look at this project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s kind of interesting, when you play with SaaS products, when they want to radically change their UI UX, they&#8217;ll typically be some sort of upgrade path. There&#8217;ll be a button in the UI saying, do you want to try out the new interface? And you click the button, and there you go, and you have a period of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But typically, the companies presumably dog fooded at that UI UX and figured out, okay, this is the end result, this is basically what we want to offer, and we&#8217;re at the point now where we just want a little bit of guidance, where we&#8217;ve gone wrong on a few minor points. And then some people opt into it, and stay with it, other people say, actually, do you know what? I&#8217;m just going to stay with the old interface for a little while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve got that kind of in WordPress, you know, if you use a block-based theme then those options become available, but if you use a, in air quotes, classic theme, you&#8217;re still with how it always was. But I do think that we&#8217;re presented with a different problem in that it&#8217;s so very different, and so in a state of flux. And there&#8217;s so much that has changed, and so much that will change. I feel it&#8217;s quite, I&#8217;m going to use the word discombobulating. It&#8217;s just tricky to make the decision to flip over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I frequent, I don&#8217;t know, things like social networks, X, or Facebook groups and what have you, there&#8217;s also this whole other thing of third party page builders, where people have just opted and sort of said, look, I don&#8217;t want anything to do with any of that, I want to just go with Bricks, or Beaver Builder, or Elementor, and I&#8217;m just going to handle it all that way, which makes it even more difficult to coalesce on what&#8217;s the correct path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re definitely living in interesting times. Like you said, we&#8217;re in the middle of it at the moment. I&#8217;m kind of hoping that at some point it settles down, and we get some sort of muscle memory on where everything is, and how everything works, and that it stabilises and nothing much changes. And I feel we&#8217;re getting there at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it sounds from everything that you&#8217;ve said that you are putting all of your bets on full site editing, block-based everything, as opposed to, well, any other way of doing it. Classic themes, or third party page builders, or what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why are you so bullish? Why do you think that this is the correct path? Why will WordPress and it&#8217;s core offerings succeed, do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:45] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> I think we already had that lined last time we saw each other, I&#8217;m fully in on that. So I built a production website at Human Made with the block editor that was still in Gutenberg. So we launched a couple of months, I think two or three before it officially was merging WordPress 5.0. And that was just because block-based editors were a thing before WordPress introduced it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notion, for example, which is very popular, it&#8217;s a block editor. And I was very aware of the limitations of the classic editor. Yeah, so for me it made total sense, just from the content editing perspective. And this is where it&#8217;s kind of hard to distinguish when you don&#8217;t know what to choose, and you see two people posting on X, or on Facebook, and one says, oh yeah, this is great, editors love it. Another person says, no, they hate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can say that very comfortably that editors love it, because I work with a lot of big publishing brands. They have a lot of people that write content, and they all love the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the other person maybe has talked to one person once that didn&#8217;t like it, and now that&#8217;s opinion. So that&#8217;s the hard part, is that when you listen to somebody&#8217;s opinion, you should look at, okay, what are they doing? What is their background? Why do they have that opinion? And that goes in both ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are a user of a specific page builder, you need to look at, okay, what is this person doing? Why do they like this? But the problem that we have in WordPress is that if you Google on YouTube how to build a website, or how to build the WordPress website, there&#8217;s going to be a gazillion videos that use some kind of third party solution. And that is just influencers that want to make money through affiliates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that is, I think, changing because when we look at the economic incentives for you to build using Core WordPress, it&#8217;s zero, it&#8217;s free. I can just take it, it&#8217;s all there for me, versus having a product that I recommend, and again, 30% of whatever the price is. That skews the debate a little bit unfortunately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because when you, for example, let&#8217;s say you don&#8217;t know how to build a website at all. You Google it, you find a video that explains to you, oh, we use this product here, this product like that. You think that this is what WordPress is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so when we talk about page builders, for me it&#8217;s always, you do what you do, and if it works for you, then I&#8217;m fine with it, right? I have my position on it, but if you have a different position, that&#8217;s great. But it&#8217;s different than, if you built your website using this page builder and it&#8217;s your own website, then you took the decision and you own it fully. When you are an agency and you build a website for a client using a specific product, and then this client wants to move off of the page builder, and they come to a different agency. Then you say, oh, I have this website, I have this man, this content, how do I get it off whatever thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you&#8217;re saying, yeah, we can do some automated migration, but really you have to rebuild a lot, and then you are totally falling out of the sky. It&#8217;s like, why, it&#8217;s WordPress? Why can&#8217;t you just take WordPress and put a new theme on it, and then it&#8217;s going to be great?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we get into, well, you need to understand that, yada yada. So it&#8217;s going to be a lot of technical mumbo jumbo, they have zero interest in it. And unfortunately it&#8217;s also going to be very pricey. If you have a lot of content to take from some kind of solution, which doesn&#8217;t store the content in the format that is native that WordPress can understand, it&#8217;s going to be a lot of hard work to get it right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is the data liberation project, which is going to help with that hopefully. But it&#8217;s also the case that certain page builders, just due to the way that they are built, it&#8217;s very hard to make sense of it. You have page builders that give you a total freedom that you build, so it&#8217;s essentially just blobs of HTML and so, how do you make sense of blobs of HTML? It&#8217;s very hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the whole deal with blocks is, what is not understood is, that theme building in WordPress was fine, it was a solved problem. But the problem was that WordPress has zero clue what you have in your templates. Some PHP, some HTML, some JavaScript, and you cannot go through that in a programmatic way and say, this is the title, this is the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what blocks give you is that every block is self-contained, and you know exactly what it is. This is a title, this is a paragraph, this is a header block. And so to have that freedom of customising your designs, you need to give structure to it. And so blocks solve that problem that we now can break up a design to different pieces, and customise them individually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also it solves the long standing problem of who wins out. Because it&#8217;s like this, you build a website, you take a theme, you take a plugin. Put your stuff on the page using a short code back in the day, and it looks like nothing, right? And then the plugin says, oh, it&#8217;s the theme&#8217;s fault, and the theme says, no, it&#8217;s the plugin&#8217;s fault. And you&#8217;re just, okay, let&#8217;s just forget about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then when you are a developer, you can fix it. But when you&#8217;re not a developer, it&#8217;s terribly frustrating because maybe you bought the theme, and maybe you bought a plugin, and everybody&#8217;s just saying it&#8217;s the other person&#8217;s fault. And that&#8217;s just not the great situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so if it is a block, it can integrate into this existing design system. Hopefully it gives you a few options to customize stuff. But generally, if you drop a block into Twenty Twenty Two, and then Twenty Twenty Five, and the block is quite unopinionated, it&#8217;s going to look somewhat like the theme. It&#8217;s never going to be close, especially if you have very complicated blocks like the obvious slider, you know, people love sliders, so that&#8217;s more difficult to handle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are a lot of very basic blocks, like in an LMS, a course list, course title, that kind of stuff, where we can have a lot of compatibility with themes just out of the box. And you always need to understand the problems of the past to understand the solutions to take right now. And WordPress still is, even with block themes, can be very hard to use, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because this doesn&#8217;t work with this, this doesn&#8217;t work with that. So we need to really simplify and agree on the common set of interfaces, a common set of programming interfaces, a common set of just ways that we build things, and blocks help with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the difficulty in that is that WordPress, for a long time, the philosophy was more, there&#8217;s zero in it, right? So if you install WordPress 4.9, there&#8217;s nothing in it. And WordPress was just, hey, I&#8217;m going to give you these programming interfaces, and then you do whatever you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the customiser was like that. So you take the customiser and then you build your controls that you want. But then you have the problem that different themes have different controls. When you switch themes, it breaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now WordPress is taking the exact opposite way, where it&#8217;s saying, no, we are going to agree on this set of tools. It&#8217;s going to be handled this way. It&#8217;s very opinionated. And more than the technical issues, it&#8217;s just this opinionated version of how the WordPress admin should look that is causing problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the thing is with the SaaS, when you subscribe to some platform and you do change the interface, well, you like it or you don&#8217;t like it, it&#8217;s not our problem. If you don&#8217;t like it, then leave. That&#8217;s essentially their solution to solving that problem, because when they change interfaces, their bet is that more people going to like it than people are going to dislike it, so they&#8217;re going to be fine. But still the opinion is that, hey, if you don&#8217;t like it then leave, we don&#8217;t care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we in WordPress have the problem that we do want people to stay around for a long time. We need to give people those tools where they don&#8217;t need third party tools to do very basic things. And it&#8217;s the same for WordPress, also same for WooCommerce, right? It&#8217;s both having a lot of other platforms competing with them. And we need to give people the tools that they need to really have a site that stays around for a very long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess there&#8217;s a few problems, isn&#8217;t there? Firstly that the SaaS platforms have complete control over the architecture of all the things. So they know everything that&#8217;s going on with every one of their clients. Whereas WordPress, who knows what&#8217;s going on with any one of the millions of websites? What the dependencies are, what hosting it&#8217;s on, what range of plugins it&#8217;s got going on in there. So it has to be much more slowly, slowly, gently. Just try to make sure that everything is backwards compatible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also when you kind of muddle up the way a site looks with the content, so the design and the content is put into the same interface, there&#8217;s potential for everything to go wrong there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certainly at the moment, I really do like the endeavors of locking things within blocks, so that the designers, if they&#8217;ve got the technical capacity to get in there and figure out how to lock different aspects, they can hand over, kind of like boilerplate templates for pages if you like, drop things in. You can change the text here, but you can&#8217;t change the background. The colors are fixed, but the font, that&#8217;s okay, you can change that. All of that seems to be adding to a much more complete solution as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas in the more recent past, if you hand over something to a client, they&#8217;ve basically been able to destroy everything just by clicking around in the interface. Whereas now, hopefully in the near future, more of those locking things will be possible so that, like I said, you can make it so that they can&#8217;t change this thing, or the other thing as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:14] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Right. I think we can talk a lot about the tech, and the tech is important, but the tech is just that. And the technology never comes first. It&#8217;s always the demand for the technology that precedes it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when we look at the agency world, you kind of have the two extremes. On the one hand, you have agencies that say, I&#8217;m going to build your website, if you need to change anything, call me, send me an email, and we&#8217;re going to change it for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s certainly a model that works up to a certain point, because if you do request a lot of changes on the website, then it becomes pricey from a certain point. But what we now see in the larger companies is that from a certain point on, the marketing&#8217;s not going to be done by an agency, the market is going to be done in house. And those people in the marketing world, they are used to things like HubSpot Pages, all these tools that are out there to ClickFunnels for example, and they take that for granted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they might even not know WordPress depending on where they&#8217;ve been, or what the age is even. And so they come into WordPress and then they say, I want to build this landing page for this campaign, and then their boss says, yeah, I&#8217;m going to call up our agency and then say, yeah, give me a design. Then we&#8217;re going to hand code it, it&#8217;s going to take us a week. Then I say, okay, no, it&#8217;s not going to take a week for me there to build a campaign because I need to build a lot of landing pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that is the thing that&#8217;s changed that with marketers taking a liking to WordPress, and also being more involved with that, we need to give them the tools that they need. So the challenge that WordPress has is that it needs to correspond to that really use case where you have people that know how to use this tool, that want to build landing pages, want nearly complete control over the website, and that don&#8217;t want to pay an agency to do it, and they want to be fast and quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the, I guess, path in the middle where you have maybe end users, or people that are updating the website like a restaurant, classic scenario, do you need to update their menu of the week? Where we need to offer them an interface that is easy to understand, but locked down so that they can go in and, on Monday this is the menu of the day, so that they can change those few things quite easily while keeping the design intact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s also more, you have the tools and WordPress can give you that content locking, that design locking, all of those tools are built in. But the other part is also that every agency needs to kind of customise WordPress a bit. For example, what you can do is, when you log into WP admin, you have the possibility to register a custom widget there. So you register a widget and then you say, hey, change the menu, and it leads you directly to that page where you can edit that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s little things like that end user experience where you can make it a lot simpler. And the challenge is that if you&#8217;re used to WordPress makes total sense because use it every day. But we really need to take a step back and think about the people that don&#8217;t use it every day, and say, okay, what can I customise in here to make this a lot smoother?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the challenges right now is, for sure the tech is a challenge, but tech is very solvable, right? I can teach anybody to do anything technically. But that user experience aspect, that&#8217;s really hard to do. Teaching somebody to design effective user interfaces, that&#8217;s a totally different skill to just being technical, and we need to have both at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We know that you are very technical, you&#8217;re working for an enterprise agency, and you are teaching this content. So we could have the conversation about what we would hope the project, WordPress itself, would do differently. But remove that, we are where we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But personally, looking back over the last five, six years of what you have done, have you gone down any blind alleys? Have you made any missteps that you think with hindsight, oh, I would&#8217;ve done that differently?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know, with your courses, just released content which then got completely upended by something that Core did. Or perhaps, I don&#8217;t know, advocate for something that was a blind alley and never got taken on. So it&#8217;s more a question of not what Core did, but what you did, and how that worked out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:53] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Yeah, so there&#8217;s two angles to it. So for the course it&#8217;s definitely. So I thought, well, this is a feature I like it. Full Site Editing is really great, because I published it in 2021. That was when they started work in just the plugin for a while. That wasn&#8217;t the plugin, so obviously it changed a lot. Then it landed in Core, and then we had a theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I did a release for 5.8, which was just the underlying APIs without the site editor. That was on theme json version one, okay. So great. 5.9 hits, a V2 comes out, which as somebody who&#8217;s using it, the difference is zero. But as somebody who shows it, I cannot have a video where it says at the top, oh, this is V1, right? So I need to re record that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then now we are on V3. So yeah, I had to redo the course. I mean there have been three complete redos, and then every time that the new release comes out, pretty much have replaced between 20 to 40% of the lessons. And it&#8217;s not interface updates, but it&#8217;s more, now it&#8217;s not reusable blocks, now it&#8217;s patterns, sync patterns, partially synced patterns. Block bindings, now there&#8217;s a UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s just the technical part, but the other part is more that you can use it for this, you can use it for that. It&#8217;s all of those tricks that I find out, I put in there. So really it&#8217;s more like a recipe. For example, when the content only editing comes in, then it&#8217;s when I go, this is what it does, and this is what I would recommend that to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, courses are not passive income by any means. But it has given me a lot in terms of just interacting with the people, seeing what they&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;ve learned a lot just from the people that I talk to. Because it&#8217;s not that I come up with this stuff all on my own. For sure, certain things I do my own research, and I know that from all projects, but a lot of stuff just comes from the people that are in the course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s more the other part, did I do anything wrong where I would say afterwards, would&#8217;ve done it this way? Sure, but there wasn&#8217;t anything terribly off. But it&#8217;s also my personality is that if you do teach things, obviously you like learning things, because you need to learn something to teach it. Yeah, I just have a high barrier for frustration. But that&#8217;s just me because as a principal engineer, those are the highest paid engineers in the organisation. And so if you want that kind of money, you need to bring something to the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so stuff is always difficult, whether it&#8217;s Full Site Editing, some kind of architecture stuff. So the whole thing is always just hard. So if that&#8217;s your day to day, it&#8217;s different than to somebody who, for a long time has just been building with the same stuff, and there weren&#8217;t many challenges. And now this is all changing and they&#8217;re like, oh wow, what&#8217;s going on? You know, this is all very difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s why there are stuff like course and tutorials, right? Somebody does the hard work for you and just follow along. So that&#8217;s a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what would actually, the biggest growth that I&#8217;ve seen is that when we talk about just what we do every day, you have to understand your clients in order to build a solution for them that is great. Because you have two types of developers. One developer just sits there and the client says, do this, and they do it, and that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other develop is more, the client says, do this, and then they&#8217;re saying like, why do you want this? Should it be this way? Should it be that way? Because a client cannot know as much about workers as you do. So obviously your opinion usually is better than theirs because they don&#8217;t have the technical background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you also need to understand their needs. You need to understand their need without accepting their solution of it. And that&#8217;s really where I&#8217;ve done a lot of learning just also because of my course. You know, I have to do email marketing. How does email marketing work? I have zero clue. Just the tech of it. What do you write? What do people want to read? I have to look at analytics. I have to build sales pages. What goes on the sales page? And so all of that, now I have a lot more respect for marketing people because it&#8217;s a very, very hard job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that has been the biggest growth for me. Also writers, you know I write a lot. Previously when I did projects back in 2015, I used WordPress, but I didn&#8217;t write. So anything that they say to me was, I use it this way, and I didn&#8217;t have an idea of what they meant, because I wasn&#8217;t creating a lot of content in WordPress. I was just writing code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I do create content I understand, okay. This is hard, that is hard. This is difficult. So it&#8217;s more that being closer to your clients and their needs that has allowed me to have that bigger growth. And also the challenge when it comes to building custom blocks, people get hung up, oh, it&#8217;s JavaScript. Yes, but so what? I mean, JavaScript is very learnable. It&#8217;s the most popular language out there. React is super popular. There are literally hundreds of thousands of people that are doing React.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the hard part is that, how do I build that block? What should it look like? What is the dialogue? What is the state when I put it in? Should it be in the sidebar? Should it be here? Just a slider. A slider on the front end, everybody knows what it looks like. But how do you represent six slides in the backend? You put them one below the other. Should there be a toggle? Should you be able to drag things? Is it all just one editing mask? Should you be able to move things around?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are really the hard challenges right now, and that you only get when you actually talk to people of how they use WordPress. And I think that&#8217;s perspective is missing unfortunately, a lot in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m glad that there are people like you who are giving that plenty of thought so that you can presumably contribute back, and give your opinions on how things should go from the admin side of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fränk, just before we say thank you and adieu, do you want to just drop a couple of links? Maybe a website where you can be found, or a, I don&#8217;t know, social media handle where people can get in touch with you if they wish to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:48] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Yes. My website is wpdevelopment.courses, quite easy. Then I&#8217;m on X at fklux. So yeah, the rest we&#8217;re going to put into the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, well, I will do that. Go to wptavern.com/podcast and search for the episode with Fränk Klein, and all of the links will be in the show notes there. So Fränk, once more, thank you so much for chatting to me today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:13] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Thank you very much.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://x.com/fklux\">Fränk Klein</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fränk is a principal engineer at Human Made and brings a wealth of experience from his extensive history with WordPress, having started with the platform in 2011. He previously worked at Automattic and now directs his expertise towards WP Development Courses, where he teaches block theme and custom block development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fränk talks about the modernization of PHP within WordPress, a topic that often gets overshadowed by the hype around JavaScript. We get into Human Made&#8217;s work, an enterprise-focused WordPress agency renowned for serving high-profile clients such as the Harvard Gazette and TechCrunch. Fränk explains the intricate custom backend development needed to meet the complex requirements of enterprise clients, like sophisticated editorial workflows for clients like banks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fränk provides a comprehensive breakdown of the Gutenberg project&#8217;s four phases: content editing, site customization, collaborative editing, and multilingual capabilities. We explore how FSE is transforming WordPress by integrating new editing tools and modernising the admin interface, moving the platform from its classic roots to a more dynamic, block-based editing environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fränk shares his unique perspective on the challenges and rewards of engineering and teaching within the WordPress ecosystem. He stresses the importance of understanding client needs and the necessity for developers to engage in continuous learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also talk about using traditional WordPress solutions and third-party page builders like Bricks, Beaver Builder, and Elementor. Fränk argues for the streamlined, block-based systems offered by WordPress Core, citing both financial and technical benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our conversation continues into the broader implications of WordPress&#8217;s ongoing evolution; the significant admin interface redesign and its impact on users and agencies. Fränk discusses the challenges users face with these changes and the importance of improving communication within the WordPress community to facilitate smoother transitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, Fränk talks about his experiences with course creation and content maintenance, particularly given the fast-paced changes in WordPress features. He emphasises the need for a solid grasp of foundational web development concepts to fully leverage the platform&#8217;s evolving tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re keen on understanding how full site editing and other WordPress innovations can enhance your projects, and wish to gain insights into the evolving WordPress landscape, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://humanmade.com/\">Human Made</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpdevelopment.courses/\">WP Development Courses</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/\">Harvard Gazette</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/\">TechCrunch</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/\">We Called it Gutenberg for a Reason</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/\">Developer Blog</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://joshhall.co/349-is-wordpress-for-old-people-with-mark-szymanski/\">Is WordPress for Old People?</a> Podcast with Josh Hall and Mark Szymanski</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bricksbuilder.io/\">Bricks</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/\">Beaver Builder</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://elementor.com/\">Elementor</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/landing-pages\">HubSpot Pages</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.clickfunnels.com/\">ClickFunnels</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/fklux\">Fränk on X</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 09:45:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"WPTavern: WP Engine Updates Its Original Legal Complaint Against Automattic and Matt Mullenweg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=180085\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-updates-its-original-legal-complaint-against-automattic-and-matt-mullenweg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5395:\"<p>After Automattic launched the <a href=\"https://wordpressenginetracker.com/\">WP Engine Tracker</a> website to monitor the number of websites departing WP Engine hosting, WP Engine updated its ongoing lawsuit against Automattic and its founder, Matt Mullenweg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.437474/gov.uscourts.cand.437474.51.0.pdf\">revised document</a> with 144 pages, opens with strong accusations: “This is a case about abuse of power, extortion, and greed. The misconduct at issue is especially troubling because it took place within the WordPress open-source software community, which was built on promises of freedom to build, run, change, and redistribute without barriers or restrictions. Those promises were betrayed by the wrongful actions of a few defendants, to the detriment of the broader community—including WPE.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filing continues: “WPE brings this suit to stop the defendants from further harming WPE, its customer relationships, and the entire WordPress ecosystem, and to hold them accountable for their broken promises and misconduct.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The document also raises concerns about trademark misuse, alleging that the defendants Automattic &amp; Matt have used their claimed trademark to violate antitrust laws. WP Engine claims to have used the terms &#8220;WordPress&#8221; and &#8220;WooCommerce&#8221; without issue since 2010 and 2018, respectively, even with Automattic&#8217;s knowledge. In fact, Automattic had invested in WP Engine in 2011 and remained an investor until 2018, and the companies maintained regular communications during that period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filing highlights an acknowledgment from Mullenweg years back when he publicly stated that WP Engine’s use of “WP” in its company name is entirely proper and serves as an example for other companies: “We ask you to not use WordPress in your domain name, which we’ve done for four years now. So, use like WP, like there’s WPEngine, call it WPEngine instead of WordPressEngine.com or something like that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, WP Engine argues that Mullenweg&#8217;s statements indicate Automattic’s knowledge of their legitimate use of the WordPress name and suggest that the recent trademark infringement claims are a strategy to harm competitors. The suit suggests that Automattic&#8217;s actions appear to be a deliberate attempt to undermine WP Engine through anticompetitive tactics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Engine claims these actions are causing severe damage to its business and reputation, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Loss of access to WordPress.org functionality.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Customer attrition due to Automattic&#8217;s actions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Costly workarounds as WPE expends significant resources to update plugins and serve customers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Loss of key products, including the ACF plugin and its millions of users.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reputational harm and loss of goodwill in the WordPress community.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Engine argues that Automattic’s conduct has harmed four key markets relevant to the dispute &#8211; Web content management systems, WordPress web hosting services, WordPress custom field plugins and Distribution of WordPress plugins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lawsuit asserts that Automattic is attempting to raise costs for competitors by forcing WP Engine and others to pay licensing fees for trademarks Automattic claims to control. This, WP Engine argues, constitutes a violation of antitrust laws by attempting to monopolize key sectors of the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Engine also shared that even their CEO was threatened, and &#8220;Automattic has recently escalated its tactics by actively recruiting hundreds of WPE employees, in an apparent effort to weaken WPE by sowing doubts about the company’s future and enticing WPE’s employees to join Automattic.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filing invokes multiple legal frameworks, including the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/sherman-anti-trust-act\">Sherman Act</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/lanham_act\">Lanham Act</a>, <a href=\"https://www.classlawgroup.com/antitrust/state-laws/california-cartwright-act\">California Cartwright Act</a>, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act\">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic <a href=\"https://x.com/automattic/status/1857080476776767975\">tweeted</a>, &#8220;WordPress isn’t just a software–it’s a movement. This movement, and the community that powers it, are why WordPress now powers over 40% of the web. That’s why Automattic and <a href=\"https://x.com/photomatt\">@photomatt</a> are taking action to protect it from misuse by those who profit without giving back.&#8221; They also published <a href=\"https://automattic.com/2024/protecting-wordpress/\">Defending Open Source: Protecting the Future of&nbsp;WordPress</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the Observer <a href=\"https://observer.com/2024/11/wordpress-founder-matt-mullenweg-energized-amid-wp-engine-battle/\">reported</a> that Mullenweg claims the whole saga is a blip within WordPress’s wider mission to defend the democratization of publishing, commerce and messaging. “I’ve been doing this for 21 years and I hope to do it the rest of my life,” he said. “This is a small chapter of a very long journey.”</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 17:21:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"Do The Woo Community: Host James Kemp Takes the Role of Core Product Manager at Woo\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://dothewoo.io/?post_type=blog&p=86965\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/host-james-kemp-takes-the-role-of-core-product-manager-at-woo/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:126:\"The team here at Do the Woo are excited to hear the news that James has been moved up to Core Product Manager for WooCommerce.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 10:12:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"HeroPress: From Attendee to Contributor: My WordPress Journey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=7651\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:172:\"https://heropress.com/essays/from-attendee-to-contributor-my-wordpress-journey/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=from-attendee-to-contributor-my-wordpress-journey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5659:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/3024/11/111924.webp\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: After nearly two decades, the WordPress community remains its greatest strength.\" />\nHere is Akshaya reading her own story aloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Howdy, friends!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m Akshaya Rane, a fellow WordPress enthusiast from the vibrant suburbs of Mumbai, India. You’ll often find me at WordPress meetups, WordCamps, and Do Actions, eagerly soaking in the energy of this incredible community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all began at my first WordCamp Mumbai. The enthusiasm in the air, the insightful sessions, and the shared passion for WordPress left me inspired. At the time, I couldn’t imagine myself on that stage, yet here I am today, sharing my journey with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading7651_9919d8-02 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Discovering the Joy of Contribution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years later, WordCamp Mumbai hosted a Contribution Day, and my world opened up. I learned about the many ways to give back—Core, Meta, Photos, Themes, Translations, and more. My first contribution was a ticket in Core, and from there, I never looked back.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Earning a few contribution badges along the way has been an honor, but the real reward has been the learning and the connections made with like-minded people worldwide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, I had the privilege of serving as a release coordinator for WordPress 6.4 and 6.5. Working alongside such talented individuals from around the globe has been humbling and inspiring. If this sounds daunting, trust me—it wasn’t something I planned for. I simply embraced the opportunities that came my way and poured my time and effort into them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading7651_c36762-8e wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Embracing the Speaker’s Stage</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My speaker journey began with a #WPDiversity workshop led by Jill Binder. She simplified the process of becoming a speaker, guiding us from topic selection to proposal submission. While it took me a few months to act on it, the group’s encouragement kept me going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I submitted my first application to WordCamp Kerala 2023, and to my surprise, I was selected! </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>It was both exciting and nerve-wracking, but delivering that talk and hearing how others related to my experiences made it all worthwhile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, I’ve delivered six to seven talks at various WordCamps, including panel discussions. These events have allowed me to explore new places, experience diverse cultures, savor local cuisines, and, most importantly, connect with fellow enthusiasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/3024/11/akshaya_at_wordcamp.webp\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/3024/11/akshaya_at_wordcamp-1024x1024.webp\" alt=\"Akshaya speaking at WordCamp Kerala.\" class=\"wp-image-7654\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re considering stepping onto the WordCamp stage, I’ve documented my speaker journey<a href=\"https://akshayar.online/from-novice-to-wordcamp-speaker-navigating-the-journey/\"> here</a>. I hope it helps you get started!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-sharing-and-growing-together\"><strong>Sharing and Growing Together</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I delved deeper into contributions, I wanted to share the experience with my team. With support from my company, we organized a WordPress Contribution Day, which was a great success. Seeing my teammates engage and grow was incredibly rewarding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being part of the 6.4 and 6.5 release teams taught me the value of empathy, time management, and collaboration.

That&#8217;s why having a professional digital profile is a must-have. Some people think that being professional equals a nice photo and listing your work experiences neatly on LinkedIn. But there’s so much more to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good online profile lets you strategically present yourself to align with your career goals and catch the eye of potential employers or clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, with the right tools, you can create a consistent, professional presence across thousands of platforms without breaking a sweat. Ready to learn how? Let&#8217;s discover the secrets to crafting an online profile that truly shines.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 1: Implement essential strategies for a winning online profile</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating an online profile that turns heads starts with defining your <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/04/10/personal-branding-tools/\">personal brand</a>. Think about what makes you unique. What skills, experiences, and values set you apart from the crowd? It’s not an easy thing to define, but once you do, everything else becomes much easier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every element of your profile, from your bio to your achievements, should consistently reflect this brand. Here are some strategies to keep in mind:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Be authentic.</strong> Genuinely displaying your experiences and aspirations builds trust. People can spot insincerity from a mile away, so keep it real.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use keywords strategically. </strong>Sprinkle industry-specific terms throughout your profile to boost your searchability. But don&#8217;t go overboard – it should still read naturally.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Craft a compelling narrative.</strong> Instead of a dry list of jobs, tell the story of your career. What challenges have you overcome? What unique value do you bring?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Optimize for AI-driven recruitment tools.</strong> Many companies use automated systems to screen candidates. Use relevant keywords to increase your chances of making it past these digital gatekeepers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Showcase tangible results.</strong> Don&#8217;t just say you&#8217;re great – <em>prove it</em>. Use specific metrics and outcomes to demonstrate your impact.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Leverage multimedia.</strong> A picture is worth a thousand words, and a video might be worth even more. Consider incorporating presentations or infographics to make your profile more engaging.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And remember, your profile isn&#8217;t set in stone. Keep it current by regularly updating your information to reflect your latest achievements and skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 2: Choose the right platforms for your professional goals</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a> is often the go-to for professionals, it&#8217;s not the only game in town. The trick here is to find platforms where your industry peers hang out. For developers, <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> is a must. Designers? Check out <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/search/projects\">Behance</a> or <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/\">Dribbble</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s a pro tip: it&#8217;s better to have a strong presence on a few platforms than a weak one on many. Quality trumps quantity every time. Focus your efforts on platforms that align with your career objectives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t just set it and forget it, though. Use data-driven tools to track engagement and fine-tune your presence on each platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Leverage Gravatar for universal profile syncing</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s talk about a tool that can make the whole process a lot easier: <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/gravatar-new-homepage-2.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar homepage\" class=\"wp-image-2406\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar makes profile management easy by acting as a central point for your online identity. The platform connects your profile picture, biography, and professional information – it can be used as a main profile, an online resume, a digital business card, or a <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/07/31/better-links-simple-messaging-developer-tools-and-more/\">link-in-bio tool</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has one big advantage – when you update your information once in Gravatar, it syncs with each connected platform, including <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a>, <a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a>, and more. On top of that, the platform&#8217;s <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/05/user-profile-page-examples/\">structured layout and simple design</a> present your skills, experiences, verified profiles, and portfolio in a professional format, making it an effective tool for establishing a unified personal brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/gravatar-profile-links-new.png?w=660\" alt=\"Verified links feature of Gravatar profile\" class=\"wp-image-2408\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 3: Select the perfect profile picture and craft an engaging bio</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/07/19/wordpress-profile-picture/\">profile picture</a> is often the first thing people see, so make it count. Here&#8217;s how:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Invest in a high-quality, professional headshot. </strong>You don&#8217;t need to break the bank, but a blurry selfie won&#8217;t cut it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dress the part. </strong>Wear something that matches your industry&#8217;s standards. A suit might be perfect for finance, while a more casual look could work for tech.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Aim for friendly and approachable</strong>. A warm smile can go a long way in making a positive first impression.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep the background simple.</strong> You&#8217;re the star of this show, not your bookshelf or your cat (as adorable as they might be).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s talk about your bio. It&#8217;s your elevator pitch in written form, and it needs to pack a punch:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Begin with a strong statement that encapsulates your professional value.</strong> Example: &#8220;<em>Enterprise software architect specializing in scalable cloud solutions with 15 years of experience leading distributed teams.</em>&#8220;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Identify your unique strengths and expertise.</strong> Focus on specific technical abilities, industry knowledge, or specialized experience that differentiates you from others in your field.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Write in clear, direct language. </strong>Instead of &#8220;<em>Results-driven professional,</em>&#8221; try &#8220;<em>Increased client retention by 40% through implementing automated customer service systems.</em>&#8220;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Adapt your writing style to your industry&#8217;s expectations.</strong> Software developers might focus on technical achievements, while marketing professionals might highlight creative campaigns and measurable outcomes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Structure your bio to address your target audience&#8217;s needs</strong>. For recruiters, emphasize career progression and achievements. For potential clients, focus on problems you&#8217;ve solved and value delivered. For industry peers, highlight your contributions to the field and areas of expertise.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>Try A/B testing different versions of your bio and profile picture. See which ones get more engagement and refine accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s where Gravatar comes in handy again. Use it as your central hub, then create platform-specific &#8220;satellite&#8221; bios that link back to your comprehensive Gravatar profile. This way, you can tailor your message for each platform while maintaining a consistent core identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 4: Showcase skills and achievements effectively</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Demonstrating your skills and achievements is like showing your professional superpowers. Here&#8217;s how to do it right:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Prioritize relevant skills. </strong>Focus on abilities that align with your current career goals. Not every skill needs to be listed – quality beats quantity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use quantifiable achievements. </strong>Numbers speak louder than words. Did you increase sales by 30%? Mention it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Highlight certifications and awards. </strong>These serve as third-party validation of your expertise.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Share testimonials. </strong>Let others sing your praises. A glowing recommendation from a colleague or client can be incredibly powerful.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consider using a skills matrix or visual representation. </strong>This can make it easy to scan your abilities at a glance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 5: Optimize your profile for recruiters and job searches</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimizing your profile for both human recruiters and applicant tracking systems (ATS) requires strategic planning and precise execution:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Start with targeted industry terminology. </strong>Research job descriptions in your desired roles and incorporate relevant terms naturally throughout your profile. For example, a UX designer might include specific methodologies like &#8220;user research,&#8221; &#8220;wireframing,&#8221; and &#8220;usability testing.&#8221;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Focus on detailed, measurable accomplishments in each role.</strong> Instead of &#8220;Led marketing campaigns,&#8221; write &#8220;Led 12 marketing campaigns generating $2M in revenue through targeted email and social media strategies.&#8221;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Boost visibility through strategic content sharing. </strong>Post or share industry analysis, project case studies, or professional insights weekly. This activity signals to recruiters that you&#8217;re actively engaged in your field.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Review your privacy settings carefully. </strong>Enable profile visibility for recruiters and ensure your contact information is current. LinkedIn&#8217;s &#8220;Open to Work&#8221; feature can be particularly effective when used selectively.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Track your profile&#8217;s performance using built-in analytics tools.</strong> Monitor profile views and search appearances, then adjust your content strategy based on these metrics.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 6: Build and engage with your network</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a strong professional network requires strategic outreach and meaningful engagement. Here&#8217;s how to maximize your networking effectiveness:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Craft personalized connection requests that demonstrate genuine interest.</strong> Example: &#8220;<em>Your presentation on AI ethics at the Tech Summit was fascinating. I&#8217;d appreciate connecting to discuss your insights on responsible AI development.</em>&#8220;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Participate actively in professional groups related to your expertise. </strong>Share practical insights, answer technical questions, and initiate discussions about industry trends. Quality contributions establish you as a knowledgeable peer.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Implement a structured engagement strategy.</strong> Dedicate 15 minutes daily to interact with industry content, focusing on thoughtful comments that add value to the discussion.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Leverage virtual professional events strategically.</strong> Research speakers and attendees beforehand, prepare relevant questions, and follow up with meaningful connection requests afterward.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus on building mutually beneficial relationships by offering assistance <em>before </em>asking for favors. Your network&#8217;s strength lies in the value exchange between members.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 7: Continuous improvement and profile maintenance</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining an effective online presence requires systematic monitoring and regular updates to reflect your professional growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Implement a structured review schedule.</strong> Set quarterly calendar reminders to assess your profile&#8217;s relevance and completeness. This means your online presence accurately reflects your current capabilities and achievements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Document professional accomplishments as they occur.</strong> Create a dedicated spreadsheet or note system to track new certifications, project outcomes, and quantifiable achievements. This makes profile updates more efficient and comprehensive.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use platform analytics effectively. </strong>Monitor key metrics such as profile views, search appearances, and engagement rates. Use this data to identify patterns and optimize your content strategy accordingly.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Establish a peer review system. </strong>Develop relationships with respected colleagues who can provide specific, actionable feedback on your profile&#8217;s effectiveness and areas for improvement.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Common mistakes to avoid when creating an online profile</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain profile missteps can significantly diminish your professional impact. Here&#8217;s how to avoid these common pitfalls:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Incomplete sections signal a lack of attention to detail.</strong> Fill out each section thoroughly, but purposefully. A partial employment history or missing education details can raise red flags for recruiters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Outdated information undermines credibility. </strong>Remove obsolete skills, update employment status promptly, and refresh contact details immediately when they change.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Unprofessional imagery damages first impressions.</strong> Replace casual photos, low-resolution images, or group pictures with a clear, professional headshot.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Generic descriptions waste valuable profile space.</strong> Replace overused phrases like &#8220;<em>team player</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>results-driven</em>&#8221; with specific examples: &#8220;<em>Led cross-functional team of 8 to deliver $1M project under budget.</em>&#8220;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Inconsistent information across platforms creates confusion.</strong> Ensure your job titles, dates, and accomplishments align across all professional profiles.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Neglecting privacy settings can expose sensitive information. </strong>Review and adjust visibility settings regularly, particularly when sharing personal updates or career changes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Take charge of your online identity with Gravatar today</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A polished online presence makes a measurable difference in professional advancement and networking opportunities. Each profile update, every connection, and all interactions contribute to your professional story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar offers a sophisticated solution to streamline this process:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sync your profile across thousands of platforms automatically, from GitHub to Slack and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create a customizable profile that functions as your professional hub.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Integrate social media profiles, portfolios, and website links.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Control your data sharing with a privacy-first design.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Personalize your presence with custom domain support – available through WordPress.com domain registration.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of Gravatar as your professional command center. It eliminates the hassle of managing multiple profiles while ensuring your professional identity remains consistent and compelling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to make your mark? <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/log-in/link?client_id=1854&redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic-api.wordpress.com%2Foauth2%2Fauthorize%3Fclient_id%3D1854%26response_type%3Dcode%26blog_id%3D0%26state%3De703ba11e8d0b0894bbbc4731bddd3a0fd4e1d8aa36b3519f01cf7305f56c738%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgravatar.com%252Fconnect%252F%253Faction%253Drequest_access_token%26gravatar_from%3Dsignup%26from-calypso%3D1&gravatar_from=signup\">Create your Gravatar profile now</a> and transform the way you manage your professional presence.

6.7, code-named “Rollins,” was released on November 12, introducing a new default theme, Twenty Twenty-Five, zoom out view, and new powerful APIs. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/11/rollins/\">announcement post</a> stated, “Rollins’ bold and exploratory style resonates with WordPress’ own commitment to empowering creators to push boundaries and explore new possibilities in digital expression.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new default theme, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/08/15/introducing-twenty-twenty-five/\">Twenty Twenty-Five</a>, “embodies ultimate flexibility and adaptability.” Fully compatible with the Site Editor, it offers multilingual font support, diverse color palettes, and an extensive set of patterns to make site customization easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new zoom out mode enhances the editing experience, focusing on broader content patterns rather than individual blocks, enabling users to work with content from a higher, less granular perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.7 also improves media handling, adding HEIC image support, auto-sizing for lazy-loaded images, and more background image support at individual and global levels. The release also has tons of site editor improvements and improved font management with deep styling capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the Query Loop block automatically inherits queries from the default template. WordPress 6.7 also stabilized <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2024/11/05/how-to-add-content-only-editing-support-to-a-block/\">content-only editing</a> for blocks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance has also been boosted with faster pattern loading, optimized previews in the data views component, enhanced PHP 8+ compatibility, removal of deprecated code, auto-sizing for lazy-loaded images, and more efficient tag processing within the HTML API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release has given importance to accessibility, too. “65+ accessibility fixes and enhancements focus on foundational aspects of the WordPress experience, from improving user interface components and keyboard navigation in the Editor, to an accessible heading on WordPress login screens and clearer labeling throughout.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two new APIs—Template Registration API and Preview Options API—debut with this release, alongside enhancements to the Interactivity, Block Bindings, and HTML APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the final major release of 2024, WordPress 6.7 reflects the work of more than 780 contributors and includes over 340 updates and fixes.

The underlying cause was network saturation of the hosting provider’s network that hosts some of the WordPress.org infrastructure. Although all of the servers and switch interfaces that our team has visibility into were within normal levels of utilization, there were some upstream network bottlenecks that created increased latency and packet loss that affected the WordPress.org environment.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are still working to resolve the underlying issues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Future of WordPress and Russian Contributions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert DeVore <a href=\"https://x.com/deviorobert/status/1849264002632704350\">drew the attention</a> of the WordPress community to Biden&#8217;s Executive Order 14071. He wondered what happens to WordPress when it can no longer accept contributors from Russia.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here\'s a question for the WordPress Community <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f914.png\" alt=\"🤔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br />What happens to WordPress when it can no longer accept contributors from Russia? <br /><br />What happens when Automattic can no longer employ Russian employees to work on WordPress?<br /><br />Crazy talk?

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, enhancing WordPress productivity with a new WordPress plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice. Or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Calvin Alkan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calvin has been in the WordPress space for the past four or five years, with a focus on security research. His company&#8217;s security product, called Fortress, has become a widely used tool for many hosting companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, Calvin and his team ventured into developing a new product CommandUI, and it&#8217;s this plugin which is the topic on the discussion today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calvin shares his journey, starting from his experiences redesigning the Fortress website, and his frustrations with the traditional WordPress workflows. This led him to create CommandUI, aimed at providing a more efficient, keyboard driven workflow, akin to features available in his IDE, PhpStorm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past two months, Calvin has been working on the plugin, and receiving positive feedback from the developer community, indicating a strong demand for such a tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about CommandUI&#8217;s functionalities, including its ability to help quickly navigate around the WordPress admin UI. It executes WordPress tasks using keyboard shortcuts, and Calvin explains how the tool helps manage your website efficiently, and how it supports dynamic integration with menus and can enhance accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also touch on the product&#8217;s reception into the market, and the serendipitous strategies that drove its vitality. Calvin talks about his efforts to ensure the tool resonates with power users, and the potential for future collaborations with plugin developers to expand its core offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explore why CommandUI, despite its success, may not be a fit for WordPress Core, but remains a novel solution for users looking to save time moving around the WordPress backend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about how a new tool changes the way you work with WordPress, and how a new product can become popular quickly, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Calvin Alkan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Calvin Alkan. How are you doing, Calvin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:34] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> Hi Nathan, I&#8217;m doing fine. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, good, really good. This is unexpected. This episode probably would not have occurred just, I&#8217;m going to say, one month ago. Rewind the clock 30 days, and this episode probably would not have occurred. And you&#8217;ll find out why in a little while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we do that, Calvin has been on podcasts with me in the past talking about WordPress in terms of security. This is going to be very much focused on a brand new product, and the journey, and the happenstance, and serendipity of releasing that product into the wild over the last few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we begin that Calvin, can I just give you a minute just to give us your bio, probably focusing on the WordPress space, maybe dropping some security bits and pieces in there as well. So just tell us who you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:20] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> Sure. I am probably in the WordPress space since four or five years ago, I don&#8217;t know exactly. But until very recently, or maybe like two months ago, I was mainly in the security space. I did a lot of security research. Our main product of my company, Snicco is Fortress, which is like a very advanced security tool that we mostly sell to WordPress hosting companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That has mostly been my focus so far in WordPress, very focused on security. And we kind of stumbled into like a new product two months ago, which is CommandUI, which we&#8217;ll hopefully discuss in more depth right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, indeed we will. And it may be a good idea if you are listening to this podcast, to give yourself a bit of a flavor of what the product is. Head to commandui.com. Exactly as you might expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anything that we discuss today, if there&#8217;s a link for it, I will track it down and put it into the show notes. So you can find that on wptavern.com. Search for this episode, and all of the links will be in there. So that should be easy for you to get to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a new product, brand new. It&#8217;s familiar, I would imagine, to most people, in the sense that they&#8217;ve probably used something like this before. That might be in their OS, or something. Do you want to just quickly tell us what it is, and then we&#8217;ll get into the fun story surrounding it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:35] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> The really quick explanation is if you ever used something like Spotlight on Mac, or Raycast, even like commercial products for Mac. I think even Windows has something right now with this Windows search bar key, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m not like a Windows power user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve built the same thing, but specifically for WordPress. So it runs in your WordPress site, and basically allows you to build and manage your WordPress sites. The speed that was never possible before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So when you say that, I&#8217;m imagining that a lot of people will be thinking, okay, there&#8217;s an interface, and I need to click around with a mouse. But maybe that&#8217;s what we should draw the distinction on straightaway. This is minimal mouse, I think you could describe as.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:13] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> Ideally you can unplug the mouse completely. That would be like the goal, because it&#8217;s just way faster. Like working with just the keyword is a lot faster than using the mouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it invokes what you might describe as a modal front and center. So it&#8217;s a plugin, we should say that to begin with. It&#8217;s a plugin that you install in different WordPress websites. And then what do you do? How, do you invoke it? How do you interact with it? Let&#8217;s begin there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:37] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> You have two options. You can either press the shift key twice, consecutively, with like a little, half a second time in between, or you can use the very classic command, or control K, combination that is used by other tools to invoke like similar models, or like command bars. So it&#8217;s one key combination. You can customise it if you want, but the default is, on Mac OS it&#8217;s command K, and on Windows it&#8217;s control K.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. And if you do that, you then invoke, like I said, a modal, front and center in the middle. And it&#8217;s basically a text search box. And you can begin typing, and then the more input that you put in, it&#8217;s like faceted search in a way, it will then give you options for what you could do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don&#8217;t know, you might type in the letters p and o, which might map to, for example, post, things like that. And then it will give you the different options that it ships with at the moment. I imagine that functionality over time will increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s go into the kind of things that you can do with it. So would you be able to just outline a few typical things that you can do with it, that everybody will understand. Then maybe we could get into some of the more unusual edge cases. But let&#8217;s start with the really basics that it can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:48] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> Let&#8217;s start with the really basic of, you set up a new WordPress site, and you create like a post, and you view that post in the front end. And then you realise that you didn&#8217;t set up your pretty permalinks. So it&#8217;s still like p= whatever the number is, right, you know what I mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So normally in WordPress, you would then need to go to like the little icon in the top left, and go to the admin dashboard. From there you need to find the, I don&#8217;t even know the exact name, but settings, I think permalinks, and then you need to change it. And all of that takes you like four clicks I think, more or less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And each of those clicks requires a full round trip to the server. So you need to wait to get a response back, and the server needs to render your WordPress page. So it probably takes you like, whatever, five seconds, let&#8217;s say, depending on your server speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With CommandUI, you would just open it and type perm, for permalinks, and then it would instantly bring you up the result for settings permalinks, and then you hit enter, and you immediately jump to that page. So you just skip through all of the intermediary work to get to exactly what you want without taking all of these like unnecessary detours, if that makes sense. That would be like a very, very basic example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so you have got all of the default settings in there. So if I install a vanilla version of WordPress, you&#8217;ve mapped, I&#8217;m going to say, every single setting that you could possibly get to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:03] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> The default core ones, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. right, okay. And although it might seem trivial, you know, if you&#8217;re listening to this podcast and you&#8217;ve just got one WordPress website, you may be thinking to yourself, well, it&#8217;s not that difficult, is it? I can click four times and it&#8217;s not much of a burden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But honestly, when you&#8217;ve done that 15 times in a day. Map that over a week, and a year, this genuinely starts to add up. You only get a real understanding for it once you&#8217;ve done it. The sudden realisation that, okay, if I type three letters and hit return, that saves me from clicking this, waiting. Clicking this one now, and waiting. And then finally interacting. I know it seems like not a lot, but it is fairly profound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:39] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> It looks nice on demos, but it&#8217;s amazing when you like kind of experience it the first time. It&#8217;s like something that looks great, but you need to really try. And most people, if you use it for like five minutes, then you can immediately see it, there&#8217;s no way that I&#8217;ll ever be able to go back to not using a tool like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of interesting because my muscle memory at the moment, navigating around a WordPress website is very much bound to the mouse. If I&#8217;m in a post, for example, and I know that I want to go to that permalink setting, I actually know exactly where it is. So I know that I would do precisely what you said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course, for a bunch of people who are not really that familiar with WordPress, they may have seen a YouTube video and discovered, okay, I need to change the permalinks. Discovering where that is could be quite infuriating. So if you could just type in p e r, or whatever it might be, and you get there immediately, that kind of also helps the novice journey, if you like, inside of WordPress and managing all of that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:31] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> And also, for example, one that might also resonate is if you have a site and you start to rack up the plugin numbers, like 20 plugins or, I don&#8217;t know. Let&#8217;s say 20 plugins, and each of those plugins adds like three menu items to the admin menu, and the icons look all familiar. It&#8217;s not uncommon to open it, and then you go like up and down looking for what it is that you&#8217;re trying to find. And it takes a lot of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically the more plugins you add, the more valuable something like this becomes. Because, let&#8217;s say you want to find some WooCommerce subsetting. You don&#8217;t need to scan the sidebar for the exact WooCommerce icon that you need to just go into the command bar type Woo settings, or even shorter, Woo S, and then it&#8217;ll immediately find where you want to go to. Basically the nastier the site, the more valuable something like this becomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, interesting. Okay, so that&#8217;s curious. So let&#8217;s say that I have 20 plugins installed, and each of them got menus, within menus, within menus. Dozens and dozens of options. How does your plugin know of their existence, and how is it, I don&#8217;t know, understanding that this plugin over here has this selection of settings. And obviously if that plugin gets an update and a new setting arrives, perhaps, how does it know all of that? Basically, what&#8217;s the underlying technology? How are you building this menu that must be in there in the background?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:45] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> So 99% of the product of CommandUI is like JavaScript that runs in your browser that has really nothing to do with WordPress, for it WordPress is just like a data source. And then you have like a tiny part that is like the PHP, the plugin part if you want. And that basically just informs the JavaScript of what kind of data is available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you load a page in WordPress, then the PHP part can see which admin menus are registered in like the WordPress menu bar, in the sidebar. It kind of reads those, and passes that information down to the JavaScript part, which then transforms that into the UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you install a new plugin, it&#8217;ll immediately pull that in. You don&#8217;t need to need update anything, configure anything, it&#8217;s just all automatic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you deactivate one, it will not show it anymore, or even if you use like, there&#8217;s like popular menu editor plugins and whatever. If you use one of those to rename a plugin, then it will show that with the renamed name, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s all dynamic. It gathers all the data, basically, the plugin, and then passes the data down to the JavaScript libraries that we built, and that is responsible for presenting the data to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it&#8217;s not like I install a new plugin, and then I need to go around examining the settings, and CommandUI has to learn it as I&#8217;m seeing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:02] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> It&#8217;s immediately available. And also in the front end. You can also do all of these actions from anywhere on your site. So on the front end, or even if you&#8217;re in a page builder, or inside Gutenberg, it always knows what you have available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so let me just parse that so I&#8217;m sure that we&#8217;ve got it correct. So the first thing is, if I was to install CommandUI on an existing site, which has, let&#8217;s say, oh gosh, let&#8217;s go nuts, 50 plugins. The settings within those plugins would be available immediately. I wouldn&#8217;t have to wait for anything to be crawled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:30] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> So navigation is really just one part of what it does. But everything you see in the sidebar, so like the top level menu items, the little sub settings, these are all immediately available. And then it also picks up on any, for example, custom post types that a plugin might create. So you can create post types from within it, you can search across post types. So it&#8217;s all dynamic. There isn&#8217;t even like a configuration page for CommandUI. And that&#8217;s like kind of how I want to be, like just install it, and then it just kind of works, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think we&#8217;ve grasped that. And we&#8217;ll get onto those other use cases in a moment. But also you mentioned page builders. But the example that you gave was in the WP admin area, so you want to change a setting, for example. Are you saying that this can be invoked wherever you may be in your WordPress website? So you could be editing a post, you could be in a page builder. Elementor, Beaver Builder, what have you. You can do the same command K, it will come right up no matter where you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:22] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> Correct. You could, for example, let&#8217;s say you are editing a page with Gutenberg, and then you realise that you missed your favorite block plugin that adds like custom blocks, or collections. You could install a plugin from the repository without ever leaving the Gutenberg editor. And then you would see these blocks available because you can also activate the plugin from within the post that you&#8217;re currently editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Gutenberg is dynamic. So I think Gutenberg fetches new blocks dynamically once they&#8217;re available, and then you could immediately use them without first leaving, going back, then going back into Gutenberg. So it&#8217;s like everywhere, and like I said, it saves a huge amount of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Fascinating. Okay, so we understand that it&#8217;s everywhere. We understand that it can get into settings, and you mentioned that you could modify the settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about some of the other slightly less normal use cases. So as an example, if I wanted to, I don&#8217;t know, create a new post of a custom post type of my design. It would allow me to do that I&#8217;m guessing as well? There&#8217;s a keyboard shortcut for add, I don&#8217;t know, custom post, or add taxonomy, or whatever it may be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:26] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> You can actually press the C key, the letter C, anywhere on your site, and then it will bring up a subsection of CommandUI where you can just choose the post type that you want to create. So let&#8217;s say if you type C, it opens up the model, and then you just type P for post, or P O to narrow it down if you have a lot. And then you hit enter, and then it immediately brings you to the page where you can create a new post type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that not only works for the core post types, it also works dynamically for every single plugin that you install. So if you install ACF, for example, then you can press the C key, type ACF, and then you immediately get the option to create either ACF field group, or an ACF taxonomy, or you can even create ACF post type with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t do it inside the model because every post type, if it&#8217;s a custom plugin, might require different fields that we might not know about, but we immediately send you to the page where you can start creating the post type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is it possible to, with CommandUI, is it possible to open up things in a different tab or window? So as an example, I&#8217;m in the middle of a post, I&#8217;m in the flow, but I know that I need to modify some setting briefly, quickly over in a new thing. And typically I&#8217;d have to, I don&#8217;t know, right click, open new tab, navigate blah, blah, blah. So it can do all of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:39] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> By default, if you select an action with enter, then it opens it in the same window. If you select it with command, or control on Windows, and enter, then it opens the same action in a new tab. That is very useful. Like a lot of people have given me the feedback of like, this basically allows them to use their laptop without having 20 different chrome tabs open, because you don&#8217;t need to like save all those spots where you might want to go to later. You can just open it in a new tab, do your work, close the tab, and you&#8217;re back to where you were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I mean, that&#8217;s a very typical frustration for me, is that I will halfway through something, and I don&#8217;t want to close it in case I, I don&#8217;t know, just forget where I was or something. I want to be able to open immediately the setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:20] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> But why don&#8217;t you want to close it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:23] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> Probably because you know it would take you like a lot of time to get back to that page. That&#8217;s why you don&#8217;t want to close it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s lots of little quality of life things basically it sort of sounds like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so we know it can do settings. We know it can interact with posts. We know that you can open things in new tabs so that you don&#8217;t have to navigate from what you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does it do anything kind of quirky? I&#8217;m going to use the word quirky there. Does it do things that one might not expect? Have you built into it functionality that you thought, ooh, this is curious, maybe nobody will use this, but let&#8217;s see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:52] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> Probably. You can do a lot of little things that don&#8217;t really matter in the grand scheme of things. For example, toggle the admin sidebar or, I don&#8217;t know, if you&#8217;re on the dashboard page, you can toggle, or collapse all of these widgets on the dashboard in WP admin. Or use it to log out of your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s a lot of these little things in there that, on its own, they wouldn&#8217;t blow you away, right? But it kind of all adds up. And if you can do, eventually, everything in there, I want to have as much in there as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And an important part that allows it to do this is because we built the entire search behind it from scratch. So we&#8217;ve tested this with like 100k items to be searched in the command bar. It doesn&#8217;t even break a sweat. It&#8217;s still in the sub 100 milliseconds for hundred thousands of items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s really no limit to how many things and actions you can put in there. And it doesn&#8217;t overwhelm you either because you only get shown what kind of matches your search query. I want to have as much things possible in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So are you imagining a scenario where it can search, for example, the content of posts? So for example, I want to track down a post with the word Calvin in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:56] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> Right now it can already search all your users and every single post type. So posts, pages, every custom post type you create. For example, WooCommerce products, there&#8217;s a post type, so it can search those. But it only searches right now the titles. So you kind of need to at least roughly have an idea of where you want to go, that&#8217;s the search. That&#8217;s basically how it operates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You roughly need to have an idea what you&#8217;re looking for. Maybe a couple of letters, or an initial if you want to find the user Nathan, but you don&#8217;t know the last name maybe, or the email, you could just type N A and you&#8217;d probably find it. But it&#8217;s not really like the best UI for like exploratory searches. That&#8217;s not the best model with the search bar, and result is not the best use case for exploring what&#8217;s there if you don&#8217;t really know what you&#8217;re looking for yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. What I was describing is more the kind of search that you would have on the front end, isn&#8217;t it? Where you want to, I don&#8217;t know, search for a particular episode of a podcast, for example, with the word Calvin. And you would typically do that on the front end, and that&#8217;s an entirely different enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we&#8217;ve been talking, it suddenly occurred to me that, and I don&#8217;t know what your posture is on this, I don&#8217;t know how much work you&#8217;ve put into it, but it feels like you&#8217;ve thrown the doors open to perhaps a more accessible website because obviously we&#8217;re using the keyboard suddenly to navigate all the things. And I don&#8217;t know if the UI that you&#8217;ve built, you&#8217;ve had that in mind in the background, or coincidentally it happens to satisfy that. What&#8217;s gone on from the accessibility side to make this product usable?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:18] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> A lot of work into accessibility. I&#8217;ve worked with Gen Herres, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re familiar with her. She does lot of work in the accessibility space in WordPress. The website I think is Easy Accessibility Guide. I&#8217;ve worked a lot with her because she told me like about the potential this has for users with assistive technology. And we&#8217;ve worked really, really hard to improve the admin experience for users with assistive technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building something like this, like that is so interactive in a way that doesn&#8217;t compromise power users, and users with assistive technology is really, really difficult. It&#8217;s not like a form where you go with the basics and then you&#8217;re good. Like this really, really needs a lot of custom work. But it turned out amazing. Every single item, every single search result is read out by the screen reader. Every single announcement, for example, if you install a plugin, then the screen reader will read out the progress information, like installing plugin, installed plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything is keyboard accessible. Everything has the proper aria labels. We did a lot of work there basically. Even things where if you close the model, it restores the focus back to where you&#8217;ve been to before on the page. I really think it has a lot of potential in the accessibility space to help people use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it just occurred to me that it was, in a sense, it was a really great interface for doing just that, because once you&#8217;re in the modal, you&#8217;re in the search bar, then you are basically using text. And if you can navigate through that with the tab key, or whatever it may be, with all the different assistive technologies out there, then that would be really useful. And it would circumvent that long journey of trying to find the menu, then finding the sub menu, then going through all the options, and toggling it on, or toggling it off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:50] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> I think Gen did a video the other day about it, where she goes through the plugin with a screen reader and basically shows you how a user with a screen reader would experience that. So maybe you can link to it in a show notes later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s perfect. I will make sure that that goes into the show notes so that people can examine that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing I was going to ask is, do you have intuitions that in the future you&#8217;ll be working with other developers? So for example, I don&#8217;t know, you mentioned popular plugins, a couple that you just mentioned. Is there any scope for them speaking to you to expose things that your plugin at the moment might not be able to get its teeth into, so that you can open up the functionality with CommandUI for the whole host of plugins that are out there in the wild?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:31] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> Definitely, one of the big projects will be having a proper extension system and developer APIs, so that either we can build first party extensions that we maintain, or that developers build their own extensions for it. For example, right now I like Bricks Builder a lot. And I use that. So we have a really good integration with Bricks Builder where, for example, if you are on the homepage, and then CommandUI recognises that you built this page with Bricks, then you can just press the B key, on the keyboard without even opening it, and it immediately brings you to edit that page in Bricks Builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is something that obviously doesn&#8217;t work out of the box. So there&#8217;s like a little integration for handling Bricks specific things. You can also, if you search for a post, or let&#8217;s say a page, you wouldn&#8217;t edit posts with the page builder. But let&#8217;s say you have a landing page, or whatever, and then you search for it, and then instead of just a normal view page and edit page, it would also show you edit page in Bricks as an option, right? I think there&#8217;s a huge potential in having as many things as possible in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One big thing is I want to also make it as easy as possible for also developers that maintain a site, but also plugin developers to integrate it without complicated setups, without needing to install like React and pre-compiling their JavaScript. I think it needs to be really, really simple for it to work. And that will definitely be one big project in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Fascinating what the future will hold. I mean that speaks to the next topic that I want to get into. Which is the fact that this is still really, really new. Really, this whole story has found its way into my consciousness because of, I guess maybe being on social networks. Up it popped a few weeks ago, maybe less, 10 days or something like that. And it feels like I had never heard of this until then, and then suddenly I couldn&#8217;t stop hearing about it. Let&#8217;s just get into that for a moment. First of all, why did you build this, and when did you start building it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:21] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> So let me walk you through the timeline. I don&#8217;t remember the exact date, but I&#8217;d say like maybe two months ago I started working on the redesign of our website for Fortress, or other product, because that has still like a design from like two years ago that was never updated. You know how that goes, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I started working on it and we were using WordPress for it as well, and I really, really disliked the experience of working all day in WordPress. So my role is primarily a developer. I use WordPress, but I&#8217;m not like a WordPress power user in the sense that I spend all my day inside WordPress. I spend most of my time in my IDE and PhpStorm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there I&#8217;m really, really spoiled by this keyboard driven workflow where you can do like thousands of things inside PhpStorm with just a couple keyboard combinations. And I really missed that in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once I started building a site, I was getting really annoyed and I was like, I don&#8217;t know, I can quickly hack together something that works for me right now. And it took me like a couple hours to build something that allowed me to navigate between different pages. That was all I could do, navigate between the admin, homepage, and the settings. The really basic stuff. Nothing to really brag about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I recorded like a really crappy YouTube video, I think it&#8217;s still up somewhere, of just me showing that. And I posted it in groups where I frequently go to, in Facebook it was. People went absolutely crazy over it. The reaction was insane. People almost, how do you say, they bit my hand off to build this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial reaction definitely showed that there might be something there. Sometimes that just happens, right? And that also then the timing was the same, where all the WP drama started. And once that started, I basically knew that, okay, like my primary customer base is hosting companies, and there&#8217;s probably not a lot of enterprise sales going on in the next months in the hosting space. I immediately knew that. Understandable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I knew that and then I was like, well, let me just try and build this thing properly, not the four hour versions, but like maybe the six week version. So the initial reaction was like very promising. And then I kept posting like videos about it, cool new things. And the reaction was always the same. People were messaging me in private, hey, I know this is not even like a finish, but can I please already pay you so that you can give me this, what you already have?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was like very promising all along the way, very good signals. And that&#8217;s why I ultimately ended up building it. So it took like maybe two months, right now seven weeks, two months, I don&#8217;t know, to get where we&#8217;re at right now. And it completely blew my mind, the feedback and the attention that it got. I never really expected that, to be honest. I don&#8217;t know, maybe this helps a couple of people, and it&#8217;s useful for me, and maybe it pays for a couple months of rent, that was kind like my expectation of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, I think most people who launch a product in the WordPress space, and if, dear listener, you are one of those people, I&#8217;m sure you can identify with the struggle. It&#8217;s not an easy place to be. There are countless different versions of more or less everything. So if you&#8217;re releasing a plugin, unless you come up with something truly different, then it&#8217;s likely that you are going to spend a lot of time bashing your head against the wall with the marketing, figuring out what the website&#8217;s going to look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have just had, I don&#8217;t want to call it luck, but if you forgive me for using that word, you&#8217;ve just had this perfect storm of building something, creating a video, putting it into some social networks, getting really amazing feedback which encouraged you to build it. And again, not really marketing in the traditional sense of the word, just social media, hanging out in groups and what have you, and explaining what you&#8217;re doing. And I think it&#8217;s fair to say that it&#8217;s been a barnstormer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since you&#8217;ve started two months ago, we don&#8217;t need to get into the numbers, that&#8217;s not important, but is it fair to say that it has gone way beyond, in terms of the people that have interacted with you, and purchased it, and played with it, and given you feedback. I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s fair to say that it&#8217;s gone way beyond what you imagined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:00] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> For sure. The way I launched it basically was, so once the product was ready, or maybe a week or two before it was fully ready, I threw up a landing page, and recorded like a proper demo walkthrough, my first ever edited video. It turned out okay. It turned out good with Descript, and a lot of these tools make it, I guess a videographer would cringe at that, but it&#8217;s like passable, it did its job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I threw up a wait list and had a little gamified approach to this waitlist thing, where I didn&#8217;t even like promise some crazy deal, or discount, or whatever. I just said, look, there will be a launch offer that will be better than the public offer, and it will be limited in quantity, not a gimmick or whatever, like when the quantity is sold out, it&#8217;s sold out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I think that the verbiage was something like, if you&#8217;re on the wait list, you&#8217;ll get 48 hours exclusive access before public launch to secure wait list deals. And if you&#8217;re in the first 50 spots, I think it was, then you get an additional 48 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s fun but I never expected it to go that crazy, like people were sharing it all over the place, and then once the first 50 people got access, a day before the entire wait list, they started using the product, loved it, posted about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was well done, I put a lot of thought into it, but it&#8217;s also, something about the timing must have been right with maybe like all the negativity that was happening in WordPress, Twitter and Facebook groups, and whatever. No, definitely there&#8217;s some part to it where people like were excited to see something positive, or some positive news coming out I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think also you happen to have a product which, if you frequent those Facebook groups, which I know you do, they&#8217;re full of people who are jobbing WordPressers. They&#8217;re either building websites, or they&#8217;re building plugins, or they&#8217;re building client websites as part of an agency or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they&#8217;re fully into WordPress, but they also realise the limitations. And in some cases they may have not have realised the frustration, but then when they saw something like this and thought, actually, you know what, that&#8217;ll save me a minute here, and a minute there, which all adds up to greater productivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you just had that perfect storm of the right product, and you were already connecting to the perfect audience. And honestly, if we were to revisit this topic in a year and do some sort of marketing analysis, I think every domino was kind of set up perfectly. And again, I don&#8217;t mean this to sound bad, but kind of by accident in a sense. You&#8217;d already found your audience because you were in there talking to these communities. You built the product, which perfectly aligned, to scratch your own itch. What a lovely story, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:36] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> I think maybe I stumbled upon the idea based on luck maybe, yeah, to some degree. I certainly didn&#8217;t expect that so many people will find it useful, or be interested in it. I do actually plan to, like once it all settles down a bit, do some sort of post mortem write up, or analysis of, this is how I launched it. This is why I did it this way, and why I didn&#8217;t do this, the decision making behind it. I also had a lot of trust, let&#8217;s say, not advisors, but like friends in the ecosystem that gave me a lot of feedback or, no, don&#8217;t do it this way, rather try this. And so I think like a proper writeup of that be cool to see, the behind the scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it would be interesting to match the people that you were already speaking to, prior to even conceiving the product, with the product that you then built, and the way that you were able to market it in a kind of gorilla fashion. Just producing some videos, and not, I don&#8217;t know, building an email list over many years and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it will be interesting because I think we all know that the WordPress space can be saturated. And just because you build it doesn&#8217;t mean that they will come. There&#8217;s so many serendipitous bits in there. It&#8217;s fabulous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that I was going to ask you, and I don&#8217;t know if you have any intuitions about this, is that one of the comments that I kept seeing was something along the lines of, why isn&#8217;t this in Core WordPress? There were variants of that. You use it for a bit and you can&#8217;t not carry on using it. It&#8217;s got that stickiness to it. You get the muscle memory over a few short minutes and then suddenly it&#8217;s, oh, put the mouse away, I don&#8217;t want that anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I did wonder if you have any thoughts about letting something like this go into Core, or working with Core on it, or whether or not you&#8217;re going to stay with the product that you&#8217;ve got. Not sure what you think about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:11] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> Well, it is kind of in Core, a lot of people don&#8217;t know that. In Gutenberg, in the block editor, and inside the site editor there is, I wouldn&#8217;t say similar, but they have a Command Palette, but it just, it never really stuck for people, getting into the habit of using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say like this, a command bar is, I don&#8217;t know, maybe the best analogy is a keyboard. All keyboards, more or less, they look the same if you just glance at them from a distance. But once you start pressing like the first key, you really feel like the difference between like a $500 mechanical keyboard and a default keyboard, right? It&#8217;s hard to describe, but that&#8217;s like the best analogy I can give for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if a command bar is not like really, a really, really polished product, technically zero friction, people don&#8217;t get into the habit of using it. And I think that&#8217;s maybe why previous attempts of building something like this in WordPress didn&#8217;t really stick around, or didn&#8217;t take off. It&#8217;s just my theory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Wasn&#8217;t it also limited just to the Gutenberg UI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:03] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> That&#8217;s also a big part of it. If you can just use it inside the block editor, then it obviously won&#8217;t stick around. It&#8217;s like the default workflow for people. But also, of course, WordPress Core is just one tiny part of it, and there&#8217;s probably not resources to dedicate a full command bar team to it basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my opinion, maybe this shouldn&#8217;t be a Core thing to its fullest degree. There&#8217;s always the saying of 80 20 rule that they have, right? I don&#8217;t think 80% of WordPress users will use this. In the same way that not 80% of MacOS users use Spotlight or Raycast. There&#8217;s probably a big segment of users that will use it, but it&#8217;s nowhere near 80, probably not even near 50% of people that will use it. So I think the resources could be spent other ways. I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s just my theory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That seems like a sensible way of doing it. I think the promise of WordPress is to be, if 80% of the people use it, then it can be considered. And I think you&#8217;re right. I think for people who are really in WordPress all the time, like you, like me, like the people that you&#8217;ve pitched the product to and who have bought it, then that makes perfect sense. But perhaps for the more casual user who&#8217;s just got a brochure site that they don&#8217;t really modify all that much, then maybe not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:05] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> It&#8217;s also, I very much built this for the power user audience. And if you built with that in mind, the outcome is very different to if built like a, you can also build like a command bar that is more geared towards, let&#8217;s say beginners that need maybe more exploratory features. So if you open it, it&#8217;s more like, hey, you can do this, and from here you can go there. And ours is very much, you type a couple letters in some random order, and it more or less brings you to already where you know you want to go. So it&#8217;s I guess built for a different segment also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, definitely worth checking out. So I think probably we&#8217;ve reached the number of minutes, which would be suitable for this episode. So we&#8217;ll knock it on the head there. But just before we go, one last mention of the URL, it&#8217;s commandui.com, no hyphens, just all as one word, commandui.com. Go and check it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where can we find you if we want to communicate about this? Obviously the website probably, but are there other places where you hang out? Sounds like you do hang out on socials quite a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:02] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;m in like all the popular WordPress Facebook Groups, mostly agency groups I think. And also since half a year, a year or so, very active on X, I think my handle is @CalvinAlkan. So if you want to hit me up, just hit me up there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so that&#8217;s perfect. I will link to that in the show notes. Well, well done for, firstly, bringing a product to market in a record amount of time, but also for the barnstorming success that you&#8217;ve had. I hope that it carries on in that same way, and maybe, you never know, in a year or two, we&#8217;ll come back and see where you&#8217;re at. But Calvin Alkan, thank you so much for chatting to me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:35] <strong>Calvin Alkan:</strong> Thank you Nathan, thanks for having me.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://x.com/CalvinAlkan\">Calvin Alkan</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calvin has been in the WordPress space for the past four to five years, with a focus on security research. His company’s security product, called <a href=\"https://fortress.snicco.io/\">Fortress</a>, has become a widely used tool for many hosting companies. Recently, Calvin and his team ventured into developing a new product, <a href=\"https://commandui.com/\">CommandUI</a>, and it’s this plugin which is the topic under discussion today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calvin shares his journey, starting from his experiences redesigning the Fortress website, and his frustrations with the traditional WordPress workflows. This led him to create CommandUI, aimed at providing a more efficient, keyboard-driven workflow, akin to features available in his IDE, PhpStorm. Over the past two months, Calvin has been working on the plugin and received positive feedback from the developer community, indicating a strong demand for such a tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about CommandUI&#8217;s functionalities, including its ability to help quickly navigate around the WordPress admin UI. It executes WordPress tasks using keyboard shortcuts, and Calvin explains how the tool helps manage your website efficiently, and how it supports dynamic integration with menus, and can enhance accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also touch on the product&#8217;s reception into the market, and the serendipitous strategies that drove its virality.

And when customer queries are overshadowed by spam and phishing attempts, you’re left inconvenienced — and that’s putting it mildly. Not to mention, sorting through it all takes a lot of time that could be spent on other&nbsp;tasks.</p>\n\n<p>While sharing your email address online is necessary to direct visitors towards your support and sales channels, it’s an open invitation for spambots, too. These automated programs crawl the web, collect public email addresses, and send a barrage of spam in the hopes that you or someone on your team takes the&nbsp;bait.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, this can be prevented with a tactic known as email obfuscation. This technique disguises your email addresses, keeping them safe from <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-a-spambot/\">spambots</a> and protecting your business from unwanted&nbsp;messages.</p>\n\n<p>So today, let’s explore email obfuscation in depth and explain how you can use it (alongside other methods) to improve your online&nbsp;security.</p>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-284217\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-email obfuscation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is email&nbsp;obfuscation?</h2>\n\n<p>Email obfuscation is a technique used to mask email addresses so that they’re not as easily detected by spambots. When an email address is obfuscated, it’s still completely readable by humans, but is difficult for bots to&nbsp;recognize.</p>\n\n<p>Malicious bots are constantly crawling the internet looking for emails to scrape and add to their spam lists, and email obfuscation is absolutely necessary to prevent spam. While this won’t help against targeted spam and phishing attempts, it will at least stop the bulk of automated spam&nbsp;attacks.</p>\n\n<p>There are several ways to obfuscate an email on your site. Some methods include replacing parts of the email with HTML characters, or using JavaScript to dynamically display the email when the page is loaded. These make it a lot harder for simple bots to scrape your email. We’ll go into the details on how it works&nbsp;below.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1066\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image.jpeg\" alt=\"someone writing an email on their laptop, with a tablet and color swatches next to them\" class=\"wp-image-284219\" />\n\n\n<h2 id=\"why-is-email-obfuscation-crucial-for-cybersecurity-and-spam prevention\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is email obfuscation crucial for cybersecurity and spam&nbsp;prevention?</h2>\n\n<p>Email obfuscation might not seem all that important. It’s hard to understand how disruptive spam can be until you have an inbox full of it. And by then, it’s too late to do anything about it except change your email address&nbsp;entirely.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some of the risks of leaving your email&nbsp;unobfuscated:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"email-harvesting-bots-scraping-your email\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Email harvesting bots scraping your&nbsp;email</h3>\n\n<p>You don’t want your email on a scammer’s list. These are sold to spammers looking for active emails to send their junk mail to. If your email is out there long enough, it’s nearly inevitable, but you can use email obfuscation to delay it as long as&nbsp;possible.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"brute-force-attacks-on-your-email account\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Brute force attacks on your email&nbsp;account</h3>\n\n<p>Once attackers know your email, they can attempt to launch brute force attacks to access your account. When this happens, they’ll try as many passwords as possible, and break in. It’s best to hide your email from the automated programs that run these brute force&nbsp;attacks.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A spam&#8209;filled&nbsp;inbox</h3>\n\n<p>Spam may seem like just an annoyance, but it can be devastating when it’s in full force. Genuine customers get drowned out and your inbox becomes impossible to sort&nbsp;through.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"being-targeted-by-phishing attacks\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Being targeted by phishing&nbsp;attacks</h3>\n\n\n<p>Phishing occurs when an attacker tries to trick you into revealing sensitive info, like your email or website login info. Or, you might receive an email asking you to click a link or download an attachment that installs malware on your device and steals your info. Basic phishing attacks can be automated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While <em>you </em>may know all about how to identify a scam, not everyone on your team might be so experienced. The more team members that have access to your business email, the more likely they’ll fall prey to phishing attempts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since over <a href=\"https://siliconangle.com/2023/10/02/report-half-phishing-emails-now-use-obfuscation-tactics-avoid-detection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">55% of phishing emails</a> now employ some form of obfuscation to evade detection — which marks a significant 24.4% increase from the previous year — it’s more important than ever to implement some level of prevention.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"common-methods-of-email obfuscation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common methods of email&nbsp;obfuscation</h2>\n\n<p>There are several ways to hide the email address on your website from bots while still allowing real customers and prospects to contact you. And the good news is you can employ one or all of&nbsp;them.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"use-a-contact-form-with-spam-protection \" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use a contact form with spam protection&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n<p>One of the most effective email obfuscation techniques is to avoid displaying your email online altogether. Instead, you can just use a contact form. Of course, contact forms have their own issues with spam, which is why you’ll need to use this alongside an anti&#8209;spam solution like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a>.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1000\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Akismet homepage with the text \" />\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet uses AI to scan all incoming form submissions and filter out unwanted, spammy messages with 99.99% effectiveness. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/captcha-alternatives/\">No need for CAPTCHA</a> or other obtrusive spam protection methods. Spam will never even reach your inbox when you use Akismet. And if you have a WordPress website, it comes pre-installed, which is pretty convenient.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"character-replacement\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Character replacement</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be as simple as replacing the “@” in an email with “at”, or replacing the symbols with their HTML entities. So an email address like “test@example.com” becomes “test@example.com”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>This renders correctly for people who visit your website but parses as gibberish for bots. The downside is that it only works for very simple bots, so you should use it in conjunction with other&nbsp;methods.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"image-based-obfuscation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Image-based obfuscation</h3>\n\n\n<p>Another simple solution is displaying your email as an image. Most bots can’t read images, so this can work pretty well. But it’s not user&#8209;friendly at all since visitors have to type in your email manually. There are also serious accessibility concerns for those who use screen readers. Because of these reasons, this isn’t the best option to&nbsp;pursue.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"javascript-based-obfuscation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript-based obfuscation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a more involved method, where the email is hidden in the site’s code and rendered dynamically. The email address can be hidden within the site’s HTML code and is only displayed when the page is loaded by a browser. This makes it a lot more challenging for bots to scrape this data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>There are more advanced bots out there, however, especially those running in a fully&#8209;fledged browser environment that can bypass these methods​. So that’s something to be aware&nbsp;of.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"encoding-techniques\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Encoding techniques</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Encoding techniques involve converting an email address into a string of code that a browser can interpret, but that is difficult for bots to decode. A common method is <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Base64\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Base64 encoding</a>, where the email is transformed into a string of characters that can be decoded by the browser using JavaScript.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>So, if you have an email like &#8220;example@example.com&#8221; it might be encoded into a string like &#8220;ZXhhbXBsZUBleGFtcGxlLmNvbQ==&#8221;. When the page loads, a script decodes this string back into a readable email address that people can interact&nbsp;with.</p>\n\n<p>This method can be thwarted by more advanced bots though, so be mindful of that when putting a plan together to prevent&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-email-obfuscation-fits-into-a-broader-cybersecurity framework\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How email obfuscation fits into a broader cybersecurity&nbsp;framework</h2>\n\n<p>Where there’s a website, there’s a risk of people trying to break into it. You don’t need to be running a huge enterprise website to be targeted by bad actors. In all actuality, hackers and spammers are more than happy to take advantage of the lax security on smaller&nbsp;sites.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why cybersecurity should be a major concern of yours, whatever the size of your website. Digital threats, from spam to malware, are constantly evolving. And email obfuscation is just one piece of the puzzle that can put a stop to these&nbsp;threats.</p>\n\n<p>Email obfuscation serves as a preventative measure, reducing the likelihood that your email will be harvested and used for spam and phishing attacks. While spam is just a nuisance, phishing can lead to losing your account or major data breaches. So if you make your email harder to find, it lowers the chances of you being&nbsp;targeted.</p>\n\n<p>But email obfuscation isn’t enough on its own. It should complement other security measures. The anti&#8209;spam tools offered by Akismet can detect and block malicious messages that do manage to slip&nbsp;through.</p>\n\n<p>And you can further secure your online presence by setting up (and mandating) two&#8209;factor authentication for you and your team, <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/blog/weak-passwords/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">using strong passwords</a> (and not reusing them), and keeping website and server software up to date. Firewalls and intrusion detection systems can also work to keep your site&nbsp;safe.</p>\n\n<p>Besides that, providing cybersecurity training to your team (or thoroughly educating yourself if it’s just you) can help you recognize potential&nbsp;threats.</p>\n\n<p>So email obfuscation is a valuable tool, yes, but it works best when integrated into a comprehensive cybersecurity&nbsp;strategy.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-importance-of-layered-security measures\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The importance of layered security&nbsp;measures</h2>\n\n<p>There’s no one cybersecurity solution that will protect your entire online presence. So you’ll need to rely on multiple security measures that work together to create a more resilient&nbsp;defense.</p>\n\n<p>Redundancy is something you might have heard of in reference to web hosting servers. In a redundant hosting setup, if one server fails, a backup server is ready to take its place and prevent downtime. It’s used a lot when talking about website backups, too. If one backup fails, there’s another saved in a different location to ensure your data isn’t&nbsp;lost.</p>\n\n\n<p>This same concept of redundancy also applies to cybersecurity. If one layer of your defense fails, others are still in place to catch the threat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>So if spambots figure out how to bypass your email obfuscation, having an <a href=\"https://akismet.com/wordpress/\">anti&#8209;spam solution</a> like Akismet will prevent that phishing email from reaching your inbox. And if it somehow does slip through that and your email spam filter, having two&#8209;factor authentication in place will prevent the phishing attempt from being successful even if you do hand over your login&nbsp;credentials.</p>\n\n\n<p>As cyberthreats are constantly becoming more sophisticated, this layered strategy is extremely important.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Akismet&#8217;s spam protection complements email&nbsp;obfuscation</h2>\n\n<p>While email obfuscation can be an effective strategy for keeping your email address hidden from spambots, it’s not&nbsp;foolproof.</p>\n\n<p>The issue with email obfuscation is that it’s static. Once you implement it, all attackers have to do is figure out how you’re hiding your email and update their bots to account for it. Then this method won’t work anymore. You can keep updating your methods, but it’s tedious to have to stay a step ahead of potential threats at all&nbsp;times.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why Akismet’s spam protection is such a preferred choice. Akismet is a spam protection platform that analyzes incoming messages for common spam patterns and then blocks spam&nbsp;immediately.</p>\n\n<p>And the big difference is that it’s dynamic, not static. Akismet is powered by machine learning that’s been trained on a dataset of billions of pieces of spam. As spammers use new methods to evade filters, Akismet learns in real&#8209;time, updating itself to respond to new&nbsp;threats.</p>\n\n<p>And that’s all done without any input needed from you, or your visitors. Unlike CAPTCHA, which can slow down and annoy your users, Akismet runs non&#8209;intrusively in the&nbsp;background.</p>\n\n<p>As we mentioned, a layered cybersecurity strategy is the best way to keep spam, phishing, and malware far away from your website. And while email obfuscation alone is not enough to protect yourself, combining it with Akismet makes for the best way to safeguard your email address&nbsp;online.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Real&#8209;world examples where Akismet has effectively reduced&nbsp;spam</h2>\n\n<p>Akismet has proven to be a powerful tool in the fight against spam, helping countless businesses and individuals alike protect themselves. 100 million sites have used Akismet to block <strong>more than 500 billion pieces of&nbsp;spam</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve released a few case studies showcasing real&#8209;world examples where Akismet has made a significant&nbsp;impact.</p>\n\n<p>One is the <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/convertkit-customerstory/\">ConvertKit case study</a>, which explores how the marketing platform protected over 400,000 creators from spam. Lower billing fees and less email reputation damage meant happier ConvertKit customers, and the switch to Akismet was a major success. It just proves how well Akismet works for <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise/\">enterprise&#8209;grade&nbsp;anti&#8209;spam</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>Akismet also helped <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/saying-no-to-spam-on-smitten-kitchens-popular-food-site/\">Smitten Kitchen</a> block 2.3 million pieces of spam. Major websites like this can end up with thousands of comments per post and no easy way to filter them manually.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1500\" height=\"1066\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-4.png\" alt=\"comment sections on the Smitten Kitchen website\" class=\"wp-image-284221\" />\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, Akismet saved Smitten Kitchen from a spam disaster by blocking spam from ever reaching their&nbsp;inbox.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked questions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently asked&nbsp;questions</h2>\n\n<p>This guide has covered what you need to know about email obfuscation and why it plays a key part in spam prevention. But in case you have any lingering questions, here are some answers to commonly asked questions about both email obfuscation and spam.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-risks-associated-with-unprotected-email addresses\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the risks associated with unprotected email&nbsp;addresses?</h3>\n\n<p>Failing to protect your email address leaves it vulnerable to spambots that crawl the web and capture them. Once your email is scraped, you can become a target for spam, phishing, and even brute force&nbsp;attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Besides filling your inbox with unwanted emails, you also risk losing your account if you fall for a phishing email or hackers manage to break&nbsp;in.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"can-email-obfuscation-completely-prevent spam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can email obfuscation completely prevent&nbsp;spam?</h3>\n\n<p>Email obfuscation can reduce the risk of your email address being collected, but it’s not 100% effective. Advanced bots can easily evade obfuscation tactics. That’s why it’s important to pair obfuscation with other security measures, like spam&nbsp;filters.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-does-email-obfuscation-impact-the-user-experience-on-a website\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does email obfuscation impact the user experience on a&nbsp;website?</h3>\n\n<p>When done correctly, email obfuscation should have minimal impact on user experience. Users should still be able to see and copy your email address. But some methods, like using image&#8209;based obfuscation makes for a negative user experience that’s terrible for&nbsp;accessibility.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-best-practices-for-implementing-email obfuscation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the best practices for implementing email&nbsp;obfuscation?</h3>\n\n<p>It’s best to avoid user&#8209;unfriendly obfuscation tactics like image&#8209;based email obfuscation, and instead use tactics like character replacement, JavaScript, or encoding. But the best way of all is to forgo posting your email and instead use a contact form with spam protection like what’s offered by&nbsp;Akismet.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-can-i-also-protect-my-contact-forms-from spam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How can I also protect my contact forms from&nbsp;spam?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet is a highly effective way to protect your contact forms from spam. Akismet automatically filters out spam submissions, ensuring that only legitimate messages reach your inbox. And since you’re using a contact form, your email is&nbsp;hidden.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-accurate-is-akismet-at-stopping spam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How accurate is Akismet at stopping&nbsp;spam?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet is incredibly accurate at identifying and filtering out spam. It’s actually 99.99% effective. It uses advanced algorithms and machine learning to detect a majority of spam. While no system is perfect, Akismet’s track record speaks for itself, with millions of spam messages blocked daily across millions of&nbsp;websites.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-many-sites-use akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How many sites use&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n<p>Over 100 million sites worldwide use Akismet to protect their online presence from spam.

Often associated with celebrations and special occasions, cakes symbolize joy, sharing, and indulgence.

They play significant roles in rituals and traditions worldwide, from wedding cakes symbolizing union and fertility to birthday cakes marking milestones and achievements. Thus, the relationship between cakes and love extends beyond mere sustenance to encompass emotional connections, memories, and expressions of care and affection.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cakes have a rich history dating back thousands of years, evolving alongside human civilization and cultural practices. The ancient Egyptians created some of the earliest forms of cakes, which resembled sweetened bread with honey. These early cakes were often used in religious ceremonies and as offerings to the gods, highlighting their communal and spiritual importance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As societies progressed, so did the art and craftsmanship of baking. The Greeks and Romans refined cake recipes by adding ingredients like eggs, butter, and nuts, creating richer textures and flavors. Cakes became symbols of wealth and prestige, reserved for special occasions such as weddings, birthdays, and religious festivals.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>During the Middle Ages in Europe, cakes took on symbolic meanings beyond sustenance. They were used in rituals and celebrations to mark important life events like christenings and coronations. The tradition of tiered cakes, similar to modern wedding cakes, emerged during this period, signifying the social status and prosperity of the families involved.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Renaissance period saw a flourishing of culinary arts, with elaborate cakes becoming canvases for artistic expression. Intricate designs and decorations made from sugar, marzipan, and edible flowers transformed cakes into works of art, often commissioned for royal banquets and grand celebrations. These cakes delighted the senses and symbolized opulence and refinement.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By the 18th and 19th centuries, advancements in baking techniques and ingredients, such as baking powder and refined sugars, democratized cake-making. Cakes became more accessible to the middle class, and home baking became a cherished tradition passed down through generations. The industrial revolution further popularized cakes, as mass production made them more affordable and readily available.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the modern era, cakes continue to hold a special place in cultural celebrations and personal milestones. They are central to birthday parties, weddings, graduations, and holidays, serving as focal points of joy and festivity. Baking and sharing a cake remain cherished gestures of love and affection, symbolizing generosity, care, and the importance of communal bonds.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today, cakes come in countless varieties and flavors, reflecting global culinary diversity and individual tastes. From classic sponge cakes to decadent chocolate creations and exotic fruit-filled delights, there’s a cake for every occasion and palate. Creativity and innovation in cake design and decoration continue to evolve, with bakers pushing the boundaries of artistry and craftsmanship.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Beyond their culinary appeal, cakes evoke nostalgia and create lasting memories. They are imbued with emotional significance, reminding us of moments shared with loved ones, childhood celebrations, and cultural traditions. Whether homemade or professionally crafted, a cake symbolizes not just sweetness and indulgence but also the enduring connections and cherished moments that define our lives.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In conclusion, the history of cakes is intertwined with the history of human relationships and societal celebrations. From ancient rituals to modern-day festivities, cakes have remained symbols of love, joy, and togetherness.

Traditionally known for their savory applications in dishes like soups and stir-fries, mushrooms bring a depth of flavor and a unique earthiness that can transform cakes into sophisticated culinary delights. Whether you’re intrigued by the idea of savory mushroom cakes or curious about how mushrooms can complement sweet treats, let’s explore the art of using mushrooms in cakes and uncover delicious recipes that defy expectations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>### Embracing Savory Mushroom Cakes</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>**1. Sautéed Mushrooms: Elevating Texture and Flavor**</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To prepare mushrooms for savory cakes, start by sautéing them in butter or olive oil with a hint of garlic, salt, and pepper. This cooking method not only enhances their natural flavors but also removes excess moisture, ensuring they blend seamlessly into the cake batter. The resulting mushrooms add a tender, slightly chewy texture and a rich umami taste that elevates savory cakes to new heights.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>**2. Mushroom Powder: Infusing Subtle Earthiness**</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For a more subtle approach, consider using mushroom powder. You can either purchase it from specialty stores or make your own by drying mushrooms and grinding them into a fine powder. Incorporate this powder into the dry ingredients of your cake batter to impart a delicate earthy undertone that harmonizes beautifully with other savory elements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>**3. Mushroom Puree: Enhancing Moisture and Flavor**</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another innovative technique involves creating a mushroom puree. Simply cook mushrooms until tender, then blend them into a smooth consistency. This puree acts similarly to pumpkin or sweet potato puree in baking, adding moisture and depth of flavor to your savory cakes. It’s a versatile method that allows you to experiment with different mushroom varieties and create unique culinary experiences.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>### Tips for Success When Using Mushrooms in Cakes</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>– **Choosing the Right Mushrooms:**</em></strong>&nbsp;Opt for varieties like button mushrooms, cremini, shiitake, or portobello for savory cakes.

Traditionally known for their savory applications in dishes like soups and stir-fries, mushrooms bring a depth of flavor and a unique earthiness that can transform cakes into sophisticated culinary delights. Whether you’re intrigued by the idea of savory mushroom cakes or curious about how mushrooms can complement sweet treats, let’s explore the art of using mushrooms in cakes and uncover delicious recipes that defy expectations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>### Embracing Savory Mushroom Cakes</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>**1.
